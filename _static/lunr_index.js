Default is 0.3.\ninitialStdDevs= Same as above except that the argument is an array allowing to set a value of the initial standard deviation for each parameter.\nEntries differing by several orders of magnitude should be avoided (if it can’t be, try rescaling the problem).\nstopTolFun= Stops the algorithm if function value differences are smaller than the passed one, default is \\(10^{-12}\\).\nstopTolFunHist= Stops the algorithm if function value differences from the best values are smaller than the passed one, default is 0 (unused).\nstopTolX= Stopping criteria is triggered if step sizes in the parameters space are smaller than this real value, default is 0.\nstopTolXFactor= Stopping criteria is triggered when the standard deviation increases more than this value. The default value is \\(10^{3}\\).\nstopMaxFunEval= Stops the algorithm when stopMaxFunEval function evaluations have been done.\nSet to \\(900(n+3)^{2}\\) by default, where \\(n\\) is the parameters space dimension.\nstopMaxIter= Integer stopping the search when stopMaxIter generations have been sampled.\nUnused by default.\npopsize= Integer value used to change the sample size.\nThe default value is \\(4+ \\lfloor 3\\ln (n) \\rfloor\\).\nIncreasing the population size usually improves the global search capabilities at the cost of, at most, a linear reduction of the convergence speed with respect to popsize.\nparamFile= This string type parameter allows the user to pass all the parameters using an extern file, as in Hansen’s original code.\nMore parameters related to the CMA-ES algorithm can be changed with this file.\nNote that the parameters passed to the CMAES function in the FreeFem++ script will be ignored if an input parameters file is given.\n\n\n\n\nIPOPT¶\nThe ff-Ipopt package is an interface for the IPOPT [WÄCHTER2006] optimizer.\nIPOPT is a software library for large scale, non-linear, constrained optimization.\nIt implements a primal-dual interior point method along with filter method based line searches.\nIPOPT needs a direct sparse symmetric linear solver.\nIf your version of FreeFem++ has been compiled with the --enable-downlad tag, it will automatically be linked with a sequential version of MUMPS.\nAn alternative to MUMPS would be to download the HSL subroutines (see Compiling and Installing the Java Interface JIPOPT) and place them in the /ipopt/Ipopt-3.10.2/ThirdParty/HSL directory of the FreeFem++ downloads folder before compiling.\n\nShort description of the algorithm¶\nIn this section, we give a very brief glimpse at the underlying mathematics of IPOPT.\nFor a deeper introduction on interior methods for nonlinear smooth optimization, one may consult [FORSGREN2002], or [WÄCHTER2006] for more IPOPT specific elements.\nIPOPT is designed to perform optimization for both equality and inequality constrained problems.\nHowever, nonlinear inequalities are rearranged before the beginning of the optimization process in order to restrict the panel of nonlinear constraints to those of the equality kind.\nEach nonlinear inequality is transformed into a pair of simple bound inequalities and nonlinear equality constraints by the introduction of as many slack variables as is needed : \\(c_{i}(x)\\leq 0\\) becomes \\(c_{i}(x) + s_{i} = 0\\) and \\(s_{i}\\leq 0\\), where \\(s_{i}\\) is added to the initial variables of the problems \\(x_{i}\\).\nThus, for convenience, we will assume that the minimization problem does not contain any nonlinear inequality constraint.\nIt means that, given a function \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}\\), we want to find:\n\n(19)¶\\[\\begin{split}x_{0} = \\underset{x\\in V}{\\operatorname{argmin}} f(x) \\\\\n\\mathrm{with}\\ V = \\left\\lbrace x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\ \\vert\\ c(x)= 0 \\ \\text{and}\\ x_{l}\\leq x\\leq x_{u}\\right\\rbrace\\end{split}\\]\nWhere \\(c:\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) and \\(x_{l},x_{u}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\) and inequalities hold componentwise.\nThe \\(f\\) function as well as the constraints \\(c\\) should be twice-continuously differentiable.\nAs a barrier method, interior points algorithms try to find a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point for (19) by solving a sequence of problems, unconstrained with respect to the inequality constraints, of the form:\n\n(20)¶\\[\\mathrm{for\\ a\\ given\\ }\\mu > 0,\\ \\mathrm{find}\\ x_{\\mu} = \\underset{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\ \\vert\\ c(x)=0}{\\operatorname{argmin}}\\ B(x,\\mu)\\]\nWhere \\(\\mu\\) is a positive real number and\n\n\\[B(x,\\mu) = f(x) - \\displaystyle{\\mu\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln (x_{u,i}-x_{i})} - \\displaystyle{\\mu\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\ln(x_{i}-x_{l,i})}\\]\nThe remaining equality constraints are handled with the usual Lagrange multipliers method.\nIf the sequence of barrier parameters \\(\\mu\\) converge to 0, intuition suggests that the sequence of minimizers of (20) converge to a local constrained minimizer of (19).\nFor a given \\(\\mu\\), (20) is solved by finding \\((x_{\\mu},\\lambda_{\\mu})\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\) such that:\n\n(21)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\nabla B(x_{\\mu},\\mu) + \\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\lambda_{\\mu,i}\\nabla c_{i}(x_{\\mu})}= \\nabla B(x_{\\mu},\\mu) + J_{c}(x_{\\mu})^{T}\\lambda_{\\mu}&= 0\\\\\nc(x_{\\mu}) &= 0\\end{split}\\]\nThe derivations for \\(\\nabla B\\) only holds for the \\(x\\) variables, so that:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\nabla B(x,\\mu) = \\nabla f(x) + \\left(\\begin{matrix}\\mu/(x_{u,1}-x_{1}) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mu/(x_{u,n}-x_{n})\\end{matrix}\\right) - \\left(\\begin{matrix}\\mu/(x_{1}-x_{l,1}) \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mu/(x_{n}-x_{l,n})\\end{matrix}\\right)\\end{split}\\]\nIf we respectively call \\(z_{u}(x,\\mu) = \\left(\\mu/(x_{u,1}-x_{1}),\\dots, \\mu/(x_{u,n}-x_{n})\\right)\\) and \\(z_{l}(x,\\mu)\\) the other vector appearing in the above equation, then the optimum \\((x_{\\mu},\\lambda_{\\mu})\\) satisfies:\n\n(22)¶\\[\\nabla f(x_{\\mu}) + J_{c}(x_{\\mu})^{T}\\lambda_{\\mu}+ z_{u}(x_{\\mu},\\mu) - z_{l}(x_{\\mu},\\mu) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c(x_{\\mu}) = 0\\]\nIn this equation, the \\(z_l\\) and \\(z_u\\) vectors seem to play the role of Lagrange multipliers for the simple bound inequalities, and indeed, when \\(\\mu\\rightarrow 0\\), they converge toward some suitable Lagrange multipliers for the KKT conditions, provided some technical assumptions are fulfilled (see [FORSGREN2002]).\nEquation (22) is solved by performing a Newton method in order to find a solution of (21) for each of the decreasing values of \\(\\mu\\).\nSome order 2 conditions are also taken into account to avoid convergence to local maximizers, see [FORSGREN2002] for details about them.\nIn the most classic IP algorithms, the Newton method is directly applied to (21).\nThis is in most case inefficient due to frequent computation of infeasible points.\nThese difficulties are avoided in Primal-Dual interior point methods where (21) is transformed into an extended system where \\(z_u\\) and \\(z_l\\) are treated as unknowns and the barrier problems are finding \\((x,\\lambda,z_u,z_l)\\in\\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}^m\\times\\mathbb{R}^n\\times\\mathbb{R}^n\\) such that:\n\n(23)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\left\\lbrace\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n   \\nabla f(x) + J_{c}(x)^{T}\\lambda+ z_{u} - z_{l} & = & 0 \\\\\n   c(x) & = & 0 \\\\\n   (X_u - X) z_u - \\mu e & = & 0 \\\\\n   (X - X_l) z_l - \\mu e & = & 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\end{split}\\]\nWhere if \\(a\\) is a vector of \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\), \\(A\\) denotes the diagonal matrix \\(A=(a_i \\delta_{ij})_{1\\leq i,j\\leq n}\\) and \\(e\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n} = (1,1,\\dots,1)\\).\nSolving this nonlinear system by the Newton method is known as being the primal-dual interior point method.\nHere again, more details are available in [FORSGREN2002].\nMost actual implementations introduce features in order to globalize the convergence capability of the method, essentially by adding some line-search steps to the Newton algorithm, or by using trust regions.\nFor the purpose of IPOPT, this is achieved by a filter line search methods, the details of which can be found in [WÄCHTER2006].\nMore IPOPT specific features or implementation details can be found in [WÄCHTER2006].\nWe will just retain that IPOPT is a smart Newton method for solving constrained optimization problems, with global convergence capabilities due to a robust line search method (in the sense that the algorithm will converge no matter the initializer).\nDue to the underlying Newton method, the optimization process requires expressions of all derivatives up to the order 2 of the fitness function as well as those of the constraints.\nFor problems whose Hessian matrices are difficult to compute or lead to high dimensional dense matrices, it is possible to use a BFGS approximation of these objects at the cost of a much slower convergence rate.\n\n\nIPOPT in FreeFem++¶\nCalling the IPOPT optimizer in a FreeFem++ script is done with the IPOPT function included in the ff-Ipopt dynamic library.\nIPOPT is designed to solve constrained minimization problems in the form:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\mathrm{find} & x_{0} = \\underset{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}}{\\operatorname{argmin}} f(x) \\\\\n\\mathrm{s.t.} & \\left\\lbrace\n\\begin{array}{l r}\n   \\forall i\\leq n,\\ x_{i}^{\\mathrm{lb}}\\leq x_{i}\\leq x_{i}^{\\mathrm{ub}} & \\mathrm{\\ (simple\\ bounds)} \\\\\n   \\forall i\\leq m,\\ c_{i}^{\\mathrm{lb}}\\leq c_{i}(x)\\leq c_{i}^{\\mathrm{ub}} & \\mathrm{(constraints\\ functions)}\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\end{split}\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathrm{ub}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{lb}\\) stand for “upper bound” and “lower bound”.\nIf for some \\(i, 1\\leq i\\leq m\\) we have \\(c_{i}^{\\mathrm{lb}} = c_{i}^{\\mathrm{ub}}\\), it means that \\(c_{i}\\) is an equality constraint, and an inequality one if \\(c_{i}^{\\mathrm{lb}} < c_{i}^{\\mathrm{ub}}\\).\nThere are different ways to pass the fitness function and constraints.\nThe more general one is to define the functions using the keyword func.\nAny returned matrix must be a sparse one (type matrix, not a real[int,int]):\nfunc real J (real[int] &X) {...} //Fitness Function, returns a scalar\nfunc real[int] gradJ (real[int] &X) {...} //Gradient is a vector\n\nfunc real[int] C (real[int] &X) {...} //Constraints\nfunc matrix jacC (real[int] &X) {...} //Constraints Jacobian\n\n\n\nWarning\nIn the current version of FreeFem++, returning a matrix object that is local to a function block leads to undefined results.\nFor each sparse matrix returning function you define, an extern matrix object has to be declared, whose associated function will overwrite and return on each call.\nHere is an example for jacC:\nmatrix jacCBuffer; //just declare, no need to define yet\nfunc matrix jacC (real[int] &X){\n   ...//fill jacCBuffer\n   return jacCBuffer;\n}\n\n\n\n\nWarning\nIPOPT requires the structure of each matrix at the initialization of the algorithm.\nSome errors may occur if the matrices are not constant and are built with the matrix A = [I,J,C] syntax, or with an intermediary full matrix (real[int,int]), because any null coefficient is discarded during the construction of the sparse matrix.\nIt is also the case when making matrices linear combinations, for which any zero coefficient will result in the suppression of the matrix from the combination.\nSome controls are available to avoid such problems.\nCheck the named parameter descriptions (checkindex, structhess and structjac can help).\nWe strongly advice to use varf as much as possible for the matrix forging.\n\nThe Hessian returning function is somewhat different because it has to\nbe the Hessian of the Lagrangian function:\n\n\\[(x,\\sigma_{f},\\lambda)\\mapsto\\sigma_{f}\\nabla^{2}f(x)+\\displaystyle{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\lambda_{i}\\nabla^{2}c_{i}(x)}\\ \\mathrm{ where }\\ \\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}\\ \\mathrm{ and }\\ \\sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}\\]\nYour Hessian function should then have the following prototype:\nmatrix hessianLBuffer; //Just to keep it in mind\nfunc matrix hessianL (real[int] &X, real sigma, real[int] &lambda){...}\n\n\nIf the constraints functions are all affine, or if there are only simple bound constraints, or no constraint at all, the Lagrangian Hessian is equal to the fitness function Hessian, one can then omit the sigma and lambda parameters:\nmatrix hessianJBuffer;\nfunc matrix hessianJ (real[int] &X){...} //Hessian prototype when constraints are affine\n\n\nWhen these functions are defined, IPOPT is called this way:\nreal[int] Xi = ... ; //starting point\nIPOPT(J, gradJ, hessianL, C, jacC, Xi, /*some named parameters*/);\n\n\nIf the Hessian is omitted, the interface will tell IPOPT to use the (L)BFGS approximation (it can also be enabled with a named parameter, see further).\nSimple bound or unconstrained problems do not require the constraints part, so the following expressions are valid:\nIPOPT(J, gradJ, C, jacC, Xi, ... ); //IPOPT with BFGS\nIPOPT(J, gradJ, hessianJ, Xi, ... ); //Newton IPOPT without constraints\nIPOPT(J, gradJ, Xi, ... ); //BFGS, no constraints\n\n\nSimple bounds are passed using the lb and ub named parameters, while constraint bounds are passed with the clb and cub ones.\nUnboundedness in some directions can be achieved by using the \\(1e^{19}\\) and \\(-1e^{19}\\) values that IPOPT recognizes as \\(+\\infty\\) and \\(-\\infty\\):\nreal[int] xlb(n), xub(n), clb(m), cub(m);\n//fill the arrays...\nIPOPT(J, gradJ, hessianL, C, jacC, Xi, lb=xlb, ub=xub, clb=clb, cub=cub, /*some other named parameters*/);\n\n\nP2 fitness function and affine constraints function : In the case where the fitness function or constraints function can be expressed respectively in the following forms:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{c c}\n    \\forall x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n},\\ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\langle Ax,x \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle b,x\\right\\rangle & (A,b)\\in\\mathcal{M}_{n,n}(\\mathbb{R})\\times\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\\n    \\mathrm{or} ,\\ C(x) = Ax + b & (A,b)\\in\\mathcal{M}_{n,m}(\\mathbb{R})\\times\\mathbb{R}^{m}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) and \\(b\\) are constant, it is possible to directly pass the \\((A,b)\\) pair instead of defining 3 (or 2) functions.\nIt also indicates to IPOPT that some objects are constant and that they have to be evaluated only once, thus avoiding multiple copies of the same matrix.\nThe syntax is:\n// Affine constraints with \"standard\" fitness function\nmatrix A = ... ; //linear part of the constraints\nreal[int] b = ... ; //constant part of constraints\nIPOPT(J, gradJ, hessianJ, [A, b], Xi, /*bounds and named parameters*/);\n//[b, A] would work as well.\n\n\nNote that if you define the constraints in this way, they don’t contribute to the Hessian, so the Hessian should only take one real[int] as an argument.\n// Affine constraints and P2 fitness func\nmatrix A = ... ; //bilinear form matrix\nreal[int] b = ... ; //linear contribution to f\nmatrix Ac = ... ; //linear part of the constraints\nreal[int] bc = ... ; //constant part of constraints\nIPOPT([A, b], [Ac, bc], Xi, /*bounds and named parameters*/);\n\n\nIf both objective and constraint functions are given this way, it automatically activates the IPOPT mehrotra_algorithm option (better for linear and quadratic programming according to the documentation).\nOtherwise, this option can only be set through the option file (see the named parameters section).\nA false case is the one of defining \\(f\\) in this manner while using standard functions for the constraints:\nmatrix A = ... ; //bilinear form matrix\nreal[int] b = ... ; //linear contribution to f\nfunc real[int] C(real[int] &X){...} //constraints\nfunc matrix jacC(real[int] &X){...} //constraints Jacobian\nIPOPT([A, b], C, jacC, Xi, /*bounds and named parameters*/);\n\n\nIndeed, when passing [A, b] in order to define \\(f\\), the Lagrangian Hessian is automatically built and has the constant \\(x \\mapsto A\\) function, with no way to add possible constraint contributions, leading to incorrect second order derivatives.\nSo, a problem should be defined like that in only two cases:\n\nconstraints are nonlinear but you want to use the BFGS mode (then add bfgs=1 to the named parameter),\nconstraints are affine, but in this case, compatible to pass in the same way\n\nHere are some other valid definitions of the problem (cases when \\(f\\) is a pure quadratic or linear form, or \\(C\\) a pure linear function, etc…):\n// Pure quadratic f - A is a matrix\nIPOPT(A, /*constraints arguments*/, Xi, /*bound and named parameters*/);\n// Pure linear f - b is a real[int]\nIPOPT(b, /*constraints arguments*/, Xi, /*bound and named parameters*/);\n// Linear constraints - Ac is a matrix\nIPOPT(/*fitness function arguments*/, Ac, Xi, /*bound and named parameters*/);\n\n\nReturned Value : The IPOPT function returns an error code of type int.\nA zero value is obtained when the algorithm succeeds and positive values reflect the fact that IPOPT encounters minor troubles.\nNegative values reveal more problematic cases.\nThe associated IPOPT return tags are listed in the table below.\nThe IPOPT pdf documentation provides a more accurate description of these return statuses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuccess\nFailures\n\n\n\n0 Solve_Succeeded\n \n\n1 Solved_To_Acceptable_Level\n-1

Internal_Error\n\n\n\nNamed Parameters : The available named parameters in this interface are those we thought to be the most subject to variations from one optimization to another, plus a few that are interface specific.\nThough, as one could see at IPOPT Linear solver, there are many parameters that can be changed within IPOPT, affecting the algorithm behavior.\nThese parameters can still be controlled by placing an option file in the execution directory.\nNote that IPOPT’s pdf documentation may provides more information than the previously mentioned online version for certain parameters.\nThe in-script available parameters are:\n\nlb, ub : real[int] for lower and upper simple bounds upon the search variables must be of size \\(n\\) (search space dimension).\nIf two components of the same index in these arrays are equal then the corresponding search variable is fixed.\nBy default IPOPT will remove any fixed variable from the optimization process and always use the fixed value when calling functions.\nIt can be changed using the fixedvar parameter.\nclb, cub : real[int] of size \\(m\\) (number of constraints) for lower and upper constraints bounds.\nEquality between two components of the same index \\(i\\) in clb and cub reflect an equality constraint.\nstructjacc : To pass the greatest possible structure (indexes of non null coefficients) of the constraint Jacobians under the form [I,J] where I and J are two integer arrays.\nIf not defined, the structure of the constraint Jacobians, evaluated in Xi, is used (no issue if the Jacobian is constant or always defined with the same varf, hazardous if it is with a triplet array or if a full matrix is involved).\nstructhess : Same as above but for the Hessian function (unused if \\(f\\) is P2 or less and constraints are affine).\nHere again, keep in mind that it is the Hessian of the Lagrangian function (which is equal to the Hessian of \\(f\\) only if constraints are affine).\nIf no structure is given with this parameter, the Lagrangian Hessian is evaluated on the starting point, with \\(\\sigma=1\\) and \\(\\lambda = (1,1,\\dots,1)\\) (it is safe if all the constraints and fitness function Hessians are constant or build with varf, and here again it is less reliable if built with a triplet array or a full matrix).\ncheckindex : A bool that triggers a dichotomic index search when matrices are copied from FreeFem++ functions to IPOPT arrays.\nIt is used to avoid wrong index matching when some null coefficients are removed from the matrices by FreeFem++.\nIt will not solve the problems arising when a too small structure has been given at the initialization of the algorithm.\nEnabled by default (except in cases where all matrices are obviously constant).\nwarmstart : If set to true, the constraints dual variables \\(\\lambda\\), and simple bound dual variables are initialized with the values of the arrays passed to lm, lz and uz named parameters (see below).\nlm : real[int] of size \\(m\\), which is used to get the final values of the constraints dual variables \\(\\lambda\\) and/or initialize them in case of a warm start (the passed array is also updated to the last dual variables values at the end of the algorithm).\nlz, uz : real[int] of size \\(n\\) to get the final values and/or initialize (in case of a warm start) the dual variables associated to simple bounds.\ntol : real, convergence tolerance for the algorithm, the default value is \\(10^{-8}\\).\nmaxiter : int, maximum number of iterations with 3000 as default value.\nmaxcputime : real value, maximum runtime duration. Default is \\(10^{6}\\) (almost 11 and a halfdays).\nbfgs : bool enabling or not the (low-storage) BFGS approximation of the Lagrangian Hessian.\nIt is set to false by default, unless there is no way to compute the Hessian with the functions that have been passed to IPOPT.\nderivativetest : Used to perform a comparison of the derivatives given to IPOPT with finite differences computation.\nThe possible string values are : \"none\" (default), \"first-order\", \"second-order\" and \"only-second-order\".\nThe associated derivative error tolerance can be changed via the option file.\nOne should not care about any error given by it before having tried, and failed, to perform a first optimization.\ndth : Perturbation parameter for the derivative test computations with finite differences.\nSet by default to \\(10^{-8}\\).\ndttol : Tolerance value for the derivative test error detection (default value unknown yet, maybe \\(10^{-5}\\)).\noptfile : string parameter to specify the IPOPT option file name.\nIPOPT will look for a ipopt.opt file by default.\nOptions set in the file will overwrite those defined in the FreeFem++ script.\nprintlevel : An int to control IPOPT output print level, set to 5 by default, the possible values are from 0 to 12.\nA description of the output information is available in the PDF documentation of IPOPT.\nfixedvar : string for the definition of simple bound equality constraints treatment : use \"make_parameter\" (default value) to simply remove them from the optimization process (the functions will always be evaluated with the fixed value for those variables), \"make_constraint\" to treat them as any other constraint or \"relax_bounds\" to relax fixing bound constraints.\nmustrategy : a string to choose the update strategy for the barrier parameter \\(\\mu\\).\nThe two possible tags are \"monotone\", to use the monotone (Fiacco-McCormick) strategy, or \"adaptive\" (default setting).\nmuinit : real positive value for the barrier parameter initialization.\nIt is only relevant when mustrategy has been set to monotone.\npivtol : real value to set the pivot tolerance for the linear solver. A smaller number pivots for sparsity, a larger number pivots for stability.\nThe value has to be in the \\([0,1]\\) interval and is set to \\(10^{-6}\\) by default.\nbrf : Bound relax factor: before starting the optimization, the bounds given by the user are relaxed.\nThis option sets the factor for this relaxation.\nIf it is set to zero, then the bound relaxation is disabled.\nThis real has to be positive and its default value is \\(10^{-8}\\).\nobjvalue : An identifier to a real type variable to get the last value of the objective function (best value in case of success).\nmumin : minimum value for the barrier parameter \\(\\mu\\), a real with \\(10^{-11}\\) as default value.\nlinesearch : A boolean which disables the line search when set to false.\nThe line search is activated by default.\nWhen disabled, the method becomes a standard Newton algorithm instead of a primal-dual system.\nThe global convergence is then no longer assured, meaning that many initializers could lead to diverging iterates.\nBut on the other hand, it can be useful when trying to catch a precise local minimum without having some out of control process making the iterate caught by some other near optimum.\n\n\n\n\nSome short examples using IPOPT¶\n\nTip\nIpopt variational inequality\nA very simple example consisting of, given two functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) (defined on

minimum surface with IPOPT¶\n\nArea and volume expressions¶\nThis example is aimed at numerically solving some constrained minimum surface problems with the IPOPT algorithm.\nWe restrain to \\(C^{k}\\) (\\(k\\geq 1\\)), closed, spherically parametrizable surfaces, i.e. surfaces \\(S\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\exists \\rho \\in C^{k}([0,2\\pi ]\\times[0,\\pi] ) \\vert\nS = \\left\\lbrace\nX = \\left(\n\\begin{array} {c}\n \\rho(\\theta,\\phi) \\\\\n 0 \\\\\n 0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n, (\\theta,\\phi) \\in [0,2\\pi ]\\times[0,\\pi]\n \\right\\rbrace\\end{split}\\]\nWhere the components are expressed in the spherical coordinate system.\nLet’s call \\(\\Omega\\) the \\([0,2\\pi ]\\times[0,\\pi]\\) angular parameters set.\nIn order to exclude self crossing and opened shapes, the following assumptions upon \\(\\rho\\) are made:\n\n\\[\\rho \\geq 0\\ \\ \\mathrm{and}\\ \\ \\forall \\phi, \\rho(0,\\phi) = \\rho(2\\pi,\\phi)\\]\nFor a given function \\(\\rho\\) the first fundamental form (the metric) of the defined surface has the following matrix representation:\n\n(24)¶\\[\\begin{split}G =\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c c}\n    \\rho^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\phi) + (\\partial_{\\theta}\\rho)^{2} &\\partial_{\\theta}\\rho\\partial_{\\phi}\\rho \\\\\n    \\partial_{\\theta}\\rho\\partial_{\\phi}\\rho & \\rho^{2} + (\\partial_{\\phi}\\rho)^{2} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\end{split}\\]\nThis metric is used to express the area of the surface.\nLet \\(g=\\det(G)\\), then we have:\n\n(25)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{ll}\n    \\mathcal{A}(\\rho) &= \\int{\\Omega}{\\left\\| \\partial_{\\theta} X \\wedge \\partial_{\\phi} X \\right\\|} =\\int{\\Omega}{\\sqrt{g}}\\\\\n        &=\\int{\\Omega}{\\sqrt{ \\rho^{2}(\\partial_{\\theta}\\rho)^{2} + \\rho^{4}\\sin^{2}(\\phi) + \\rho^{2}(\\partial_{\\phi}\\rho)^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\phi)}d\\theta d\\phi}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThe volume of the space enclosed within the shape is easier to express:\n\n(26)¶\\[\\mathcal{V}(\\rho)\n= \\int{\\Omega}{\\int_{0}^{\\rho(\\theta,\\phi)} r^{2}\\sin(\\phi) dr d\\theta d\\phi}\n= \\frac{1}{3}\\int{\\Omega}{\\rho^{3} \\sin(\\phi) d\\theta d\\phi}\\]\n\n\nDerivatives¶\nIn order to use a Newton based interior point optimization algorithm, one must be able to evaluate the derivatives of \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) with respect to \\(rho\\).\nConcerning the area, we have the following result:\n\n\\[\\forall v\\in C^{1}(\\Omega) \\ , \\ \\langle d\\mathcal{A}(\\rho),v\\rangle\n= \\int{\\Omega}{\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{ d\\bar{g}(\\rho)(v)}{\\sqrt{g}}d\\theta d\\phi }\\]\nWhere \\(\\bar{g}\\) is the application mapping the \\((\\theta,\\phi) \\mapsto g(\\theta,\\phi)\\) scalar field to \\(\\rho\\).\nThis leads to the following expression, easy to transpose in a freefem script using:\n\n(27)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{r c l}\n    \\forall v\\in C^{1}(\\Omega)& &\\\\\n    \\langle d\\mathcal{A}(\\rho),v\\rangle &=& \\int{\\Omega}{ \\left(2\\rho^{3}\\sin^{2}(\\phi) + \\rho(\\partial_{\\theta}\\rho)^{2} + \\rho(\\partial_{\\phi}\\rho)^{2}\\sin^{2}(\\phi) \\right) v} \\\\\n    & & +\\int{\\Omega}{\\ \\rho^{2}\\partial_{\\theta}\\rho\\partial_{\\theta} v\\ + \\ \\rho^{2}\\partial_{\\phi}\\rho\\sin^{2}(\\phi)\\partial_{\\phi} v }\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nWith a similar approach, one can derive an expression for second order derivatives.\nHowever, comporting no specific difficulties, the detailed calculus are tedious, the result is that these derivatives can be written using a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) whose coefficients are expressed in term of \\(\\rho\\) and its derivatives with respect to \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\phi\\), such that:\n\n(28)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\forall (w,v)\\in C^{1}(\\Omega)\\ ,\\ d^{2}\\mathcal{A}(\\rho)(w,v) = \\int{\\Omega}\n{\n   \\left(\\begin{array}{c c c} w & \\partial_{\\theta} w & \\partial_{\\phi} w \\end{array}\\right)\n   \\mathbf{B}\n} \\left( \\begin{array}{c} v \\\\ \\partial_{\\theta} v \\\\ \\partial_{\\phi} v \\end{array} \\right) d\\theta d\\phi\\end{split}\\]\nDeriving the volume function derivatives is again an easier task.\nWe immediately get the following expressions:\n\n(29)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{r c l}\n   \\forall v\\ ,\\ \\langle d\\mathcal{V}(\\rho),v\\rangle & = & \\int{\\Omega}{\\rho^{2}\\sin(\\phi)v\\ d\\theta d\\phi} \\\\\n   \\forall w,v\\ , d^{2}\\mathcal{V}(\\rho)(w,v) & = & \\int{\\Omega}{2\\rho\\sin(\\phi)wv\\ d\\theta d\\phi}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\n\n\nThe problem and its script¶\nThe whole code is available in IPOPT minimal surface & volume example.\nWe propose to solve the following problem:\n\nTip\nGiven a positive function \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}}\\) piecewise continuous, and a scalar \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{max}} > \\mathcal{V}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}})\\), find \\(\\rho_{0}\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\rho_{0} = \\underset{\\rho\\in C^{1}(\\Omega)}{\\operatorname{argmin}}\\ \\mathcal{A}(\\rho)\\ ,\\ \\mathrm{s.t.}\\ \\rho_{0}\\geq\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}} \\ \\mathrm{and\\ } \\mathcal{V}(\\rho_{0})\\leq \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\]\nIf \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}}\\) is the spherical parametrization of the surface of a 3-dimensional object (domain) \\(\\mathcal{O}\\), it can be interpreted as finding the surface with minimum area enclosing the object with a given maximum volume. If \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) is close to \\(\\mathcal{V}(\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}})\\), so should be \\(\\rho_{0}\\) and \\(\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}}\\). With higher values of \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\), \\(\\rho\\) should be closer to the unconstrained minimum surface surrounding \\(\\mathcal{O}\\) which is obtained as soon as \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{max}} \\geq \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\|\\rho_{\\mathrm{object}}\\|_{\\infty}^{3}\\) (sufficient but not necessary).\nIt also could be interesting to solve the same problem with the constraint \\(\\mathcal{V}(\\rho_{0})\\geq \\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) which leads to a sphere when \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{min}} \\geq \\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\mathrm{diam}(\\mathcal{O})^{3}\\) and moves toward the solution of the unconstrained problem as \\(\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) decreases.\nWe start by meshing the domain \\([0,2\\pi]\\times\\ [0,\\pi]\\), then a periodic P1 finite elements space is defined.\nload \"msh3\";\nload \"medit\";\nload \"ff-Ipopt\";\n\n// Parameters\nint nadapt = 3;\nreal alpha = 0.9;\nint np = 30;\nreal regtest;\nint shapeswitch = 1;\nreal sigma = 2*pi/40.;\nreal treshold = 0.1;\nreal e = 0.1;\nreal r0 = 0.25;\nreal rr = 2-r0;\nreal E = 1./(e*e);\nreal RR = 1./(rr*rr);\n\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(2*np, np, [2*pi*x, pi*y]);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh(Th, P1, periodic=[[2, y], [4, y]]);\n//Initial shape definition\n//outside of the mesh adaptation loop to initialize with the previous optimial shape found on further iterations\nVh startshape = 5;\n\n\nWe create some finite element functions whose underlying arrays will be used to store the values of dual variables associated to all the constraints in order to reinitialize the algorithm with it in the case where we use mesh adaptation.

nlOpt optimizers¶\nThe ff-NLopt package provides a FreeFem++ interface to the free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, easing the use of several different free optimization (constrained or not) routines available online along with the PDE solver.\nAll the algorithms are well documented in NLopt documentation, therefore no exhaustive information concerning their mathematical specificities will be found here and we will focus on the way they are used in a FreeFem++ script.\nIf needing detailed information about these algorithms, visit the website where a description of each of them is given, as well as many bibliographical links.\nMost of the gradient based algorithms of NLopt uses a full matrix approximation of the Hessian, so if you’re planning to solve a large scale problem, use the IPOPT optimizer which definitely surpass them.\nAll the NLopt features are identified that way:\nload \"ff-NLopt\"\n//define J, u, and maybe grad(J), some constraints etc...\nreal min = nloptXXXXXX(J, u, //Unavoidable part\n   grad=<name of grad(J)>, //if needed\n   lb= //Lower bounds array\n   ub= //Upper bounds array\n   ... //Some optional arguments:\n   //Constraints functions names,\n   //Stopping criteria,\n   //Algorithm specific parameters,\n   //Etc...\n);\n\n\nXXXXXX refers to the algorithm tag (not necessarily 6 characters long).\nu is the starting position (a real[int] type array) which will be overwritten by the algorithm, the value at the end being the found \\(argmin\\).\nAnd as usual, J is a function taking a real[int] type array as argument and returning a real.\ngrad, lb and ub are “half-optional” arguments, in the sense that they are obligatory for some routines but not all.\nThe possible optionally named parameters are the following, note that they are not used by all algorithms (some do not support constraints, or a type of constraints, some are gradient-based and others are derivative free, etc…).\nOne can refer to the table after the parameters description to check which are the named parameters supported by a specific algorithm.\nUsing an unsupported parameter will not stop the compiler work, seldom breaks runtime, and will just be ignored.\nWhen it is obvious you are missing a routine, you will get a warning message at runtime (for example if you pass a gradient to a derivative free algorithm, or set the population of a non-genetic one, etc…).\nIn the following description, \\(n\\) stands for the dimension of the search space.\nHalf-optional parameters :\n\ngrad= The name of the function which computes the gradient of the cost function (prototype should be real[int] \\(\\rightarrow\\) real[int], both argument and result should have the size \\(n\\)).\nThis is needed as soon as a gradient-based method is involved, which is ignored if defined in a derivative free context.\nlb/ub = Lower and upper bounds arrays ( real[int] type) of size \\(n\\).\nUsed to define the bounds within which the search variable is allowed to move.\nNeeded for some algorithms, optional, or unsupported for others.\nsubOpt : Only enabled for the Augmented Lagrangian and MLSL methods who need a sub-optimizer in order to work.\nJust pass the tag of the desired local algorithm with a string.\n\nConstraints related parameters (optional - unused if not specified):\n\nIConst/EConst : Allows to pass the name of a function implementing some inequality (resp. equality) constraints on the search space.\nThe function type must be real[int] \\(\\rightarrow\\) real[int] where the size of the returned array is equal to the number of constraints (of the same type - it means that all of the constraints are computed in one vectorial function).\nIn order to mix inequality and equality constraints in a same minimization attempt, two vectorial functions have to be defined and passed.\nSee example (30) for more details about how these constraints have to be implemented.\ngradIConst/gradEConst : Use to provide the inequality (resp. equality) constraints gradient.\nThese are real[int] \\(\\rightarrow\\) real[int,int] type functions.\nAssuming we have defined a constraint function (either inequality or equality) with \\(p\\) constraints, the size of the matrix returned by its associated gradient must be \\(p\\times n\\) (the \\(i\\)-th line of the matrix is the gradient of the \\(i\\)-th constraint).\nIt is needed in a gradient-based context as soon as an inequality or equality constraint function is passed to the optimizer and ignored in all other cases.\ntolIConst/tolEConst : Tolerance values for each constraint.\nThis is an array of size equal to the number of inequality (resp. equality) constraints.\nDefault value is set to \\(10^{-12}\\) for each constraint of any type.\n\nStopping criteria :\n\nstopFuncValue : Makes the algorithm end when the objective function reaches this real value.\n\nstopRelXTol : Stops the algorithm when the relative moves in each direction of the search space is smaller than this real value.\n\nstopAbsXTol : Stops the algorithm when the moves in each direction of the search space is smaller than the corresponding value in this real[int] array.\n\nstopRelFTol : Stops the algorithm when the relative variation of the objective function is smaller than this real value.\n\nstopAbsFTol : Stops the algorithm when the variation of the objective function is smaller than this real value.\n\nstopMaxFEval : Stops the algorithm when the number of fitness evaluations reaches this integer value.\n\nstopTime : Stops the algorithm when the optimization time in seconds exceeds this real value.\nThis is not a strict maximum: the time may exceed it slightly, depending upon the algorithm and on how slow your function evaluation is.\nNote that when an AUGLAG or MLSL method is used, the meta-algorithm and the sub-algorithm may have different termination criteria.\nThus, for algorithms of this kind, the following named parameters has been defined (just adding the SO prefix - for Sub-Optimizer) to set the ending condition of the sub-algorithm (the meta one uses the ones above): SOStopFuncValue, SOStopRelXTol, and so on… If these are not used, the sub-optimizer will use those of the master routine.\n\n\nOther named parameters :\n\npopSize : integer used to change the size of the sample for stochastic search methods.\nDefault value is a peculiar heuristic to the chosen algorithm.\nSOPopSize : Same as above, but when the stochastic search is passed to a meta-algorithm.\nnGradStored : The number (integer type) of gradients to “remember” from previous optimization steps: increasing this increases the memory requirements but may speed convergence.\nIt is set to a heuristic value by default.\nIf used with AUGLAG or MLSL, it will only affect the given subsidiary algorithm.\n\nThe following table sums up the main characteristics of each algorithm, providing the more important information about which features are supported by which algorithm and what are the unavoidable arguments they need.\nMore details can be found in NLopt documentation.\n\n\n\n\nTip\nVariational inequality\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be a domain of \\(\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\), \\(f_{1}, f_{2}\\in L^{2}(\\Omega)\\) and \\(g_{1}, g_{2} \\in L^{2}(\\partial\\Omega)\\) four given functions with \\(g_{1}\\leq g_{2}\\) almost everywhere.\nWe define the space:\n\n\\[V = \\left\\lbrace (v_{1},v_{2})\\in H^{1}(\\Omega)^{2} ; v_{1}\\vert_{\\partial\\Omega}=g_{1}, v_{2}\\vert_{\\partial\\Omega}=g_{2}, v_{1}\\leq v_{2}\\ \\mathrm{a.e.}\\ \\right\\rbrace\\]\nas well as the function \\(J:H^{1}(\\Omega)^{2}\\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}\\):\n\n(30)¶\\[J(v_{1},v_{2}) = \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}\\vert\\nabla v_{1}\\vert^{2} - \\int_{\\Omega} f_{1}v_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\Omega}\\vert\\nabla v_{2}\\vert^{2} - \\int_{\\Omega} f_{2}v_{2}}\\]\nThe problem consists in finding (numerically) two functions \\((u_{1},u_{2}) = \\underset{(v_{1},v_{2})\\in V}{\\operatorname{argmin}} J(v_{1},v_{2})\\).\nThis can be interpreted as finding \\(u_{1}, u_{2}\\) as close as possible (in a certain sense) to the solutions of the Laplace equation with respectively \\(f_{1}, f_{2}\\) second members and \\(g_{1}, g_{2}\\) Dirichlet boundary conditions with the \\(u_{1}\\leq u_{2}\\) almost everywhere constraint.\nHere is the corresponding script to treat this variational inequality problem with one of the NLOpt algorithms.\n//A brief script to demonstrate how to use the freefemm interfaced nlopt routines\n//The problem consist in solving a simple variational inequality using one of the\n//optimization algorithm of nlopt.

savesol, we can store a scalar functions, a scalar finite element functions, a vector fields, a vector finite element fields, a symmetric tensor and a symmetric finite element tensor.\nSuch format is used in medit.\nExtension file .sol\nThe first two lines of the file are :\n\nMeshVersionFormatted 0\nDimension [DIM](int)\n\nThe following fields begin with one of the following keyword:\nSolAtVertices, SolAtEdges,\nSolAtTriangles, SolAtQuadrilaterals,\nSolAtTetrahedra, SolAtPentahedra,\nSolAtHexahedra.\nIn each field, we give then in the next line the number of elements in

solutions.\n\n\n\nAdding a new finite element¶\n\nSome notations¶\nFor a function \\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\) taking value in \\(\\mathbb{R}^{N},\\, N=1,2,\\cdots\\), we define the finite element approximation \\(\\Pi_h\\boldsymbol{f}\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{f}\\).\nLet us denote the number of the degrees of freedom of the finite element by \\(NbDoF\\).\nThen the \\(i\\)-th base \\(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{i}\\) (\\(i=0,\\cdots,NbDoF-1\\)) of the finite element space has the \\(j\\)-th component \\(\\mathbf{\\omega}^{K}_{ij}\\) for \\(j=0,\\cdots,N-1\\).\nThe operator \\(\\Pi_{h}\\) is called the interpolator of the finite element.\nWe have the identity \\(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{i} = \\Pi_{h} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{i}\\).\nFormally, the interpolator \\(\\Pi_{h}\\) is constructed by the following formula:\n\n(35)¶\\[\\Pi_{h} \\boldsymbol{f} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\mathtt{kPi}-1} \\alpha_k \\boldsymbol{f}_{j_{k}}(P_{p_{k}}) \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{i_{k}}\\]\nwhere \\(P_{p}\\) is a set of \\(npPi\\) points,\nIn the formula (35), the list \\(p_{k},\\, j_{k},\\, i_{k}\\) depend just on the type of finite element (not on the element), but the coefficient \\(\\alpha_{k}\\) can be depending on the element.\n\nTip\nClassical scalar Lagrange finite element\nWith the classical scalar Lagrange finite element, we have \\(\\mathtt{kPi}=\\mathtt{npPi}=\\mathtt{NbOfNode}\\) and\n\n\\(P_{p}\\) is the point of the nodal points.\nthe \\(\\alpha_k=1\\), because we take the value of the function at the point \\(P_{k}\\).\n\\(p_{k}=k\\) , \\(j_{k}=k\\) because we have one node per function.\n\\(j_{k}=0\\) because \\(N=1\\).\n\n\n\nTip\nThe Raviart-Thomas finite element\n\n(36)¶\\[RT0_{h} = \\{ \\mathbf{v} \\in H(div) / \\forall K \\in\n\\mathcal{T}_{h} \\quad \\mathbf{v}_{|K}(x,y) =\n\\vecttwo{\\alpha_{K}}{\\beta_{K}} + \\gamma_{K}\\vecttwo{x}{y} \\}\\]\nThe degrees of freedom are the flux through an edge \\(e\\) of the mesh, where the flux of the function \\(\\mathbf{f} : \\mathbb{R}^2 \\longrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2\\) is \\(\\int_{e} \\mathbf{f}.n_{e}\\), \\(n_{e}\\) is the unit normal of edge \\(e\\) (this implies a orientation of all the edges of the mesh, for example we can use the global numbering of the edge vertices and we just go to small to large number).\nTo compute this flux, we use a quadrature formula with one point, the middle point of the edge.\nConsider a triangle \\(T\\) with three vertices \\((\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c})\\).\nLet denote the vertices numbers by \\(i_{a},i_{b},i_{c}\\), and define the three edge vectors \\(\\mathbf{e}^{0},\\mathbf{e}^{1},\\mathbf{e}^{2}\\) by \\(sgn(i_{b}-i_{c})(\\mathbf{b}-\\mathbf{c})\\), \\(sgn(i_{c}-i_{a})(\\mathbf{c}-\\mathbf{a})\\), \\(sgn(i_{a}-i_{b})(\\mathbf{a}-\\mathbf{b})\\).\nThe three basis functions are:\n\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{0}= \\frac{sgn(i_{b}-i_{c})}{2|T|}(x-a),\\quad \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{1}= \\frac{sgn(i_{c}-i_{a})}{2|T|}(x-b),\\quad \\boldsymbol{\\omega}^{K}_{2}= \\frac{sgn(i_{a}-i_{b})}{2|T|}(x-c),\\]\nwhere \\(|T|\\) is the area of the triangle \\(T\\).\nSo we have \\(N=2\\), \\(\\mathtt{kPi}=6; \\mathtt{npPi}=3;\\) and:\n\n\n\\(P_{p} = \\left\\{\\frac{\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c}}{2}, \\frac{\\mathbf{a}+\\mathbf{c}}{2}, \\frac{\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{a}}{2} \\right\\}\\)\n\n\\(\\alpha_{0}= - \\mathbf{e}^{0}_{2}, \\alpha_{1}= \\mathbf{e}^{0}_{1}\\),\\(\\alpha_{2}= - \\mathbf{e}^{1}_{2}, \\alpha_{3}= \\mathbf{e}^{1}_{1}\\),\n\\(\\alpha_{4}= - \\mathbf{e}^{2}_{2}, \\alpha_{5}= \\mathbf{e}^{2}_{1}\\) (effectively, the vector\n\\((-\\mathbf{e}^{m}_{2}, \\mathbf{e}^{m}_{1})\\) is orthogonal to the edge \\(\\mathbf{e}^{m}= (e^m_{1},e^m_{2})\\) with\na length equal to the side of the edge or equal to \\(\\int_{e^m} 1\\)).\n\n\n\\(i_{k}=\\{0,0,1,1,2,2\\}\\),\n\\(p_{k}=\\{0,0,1,1,2,2\\}\\) , \\(j_{k}=\\{0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1\\}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich class to add?¶\nAdd file FE_ADD.cpp in directory FreeFem-sources/src/femlib for\nexample first to initialize :\n#include \"error.hpp\"\n#include \"rgraph.hpp\"\nusing namespace std;\n#include \"RNM.hpp\"\n#include \"fem.hpp\"\n#include

is formed with the concatenation of five array of\nsize NbDoF and one array of size N.\nThis array is:\nint TypeOfFE_RTortho::Data[] = {\n    //for each df 0, 1, 3:\n    3, 4, 5, //the support of the

static or dynamic link so at the end of the file, we add:\nWith dynamic link it is very simple (see section Dynamical link), just add before the end of FEM2d namespace:\n    static TypeOfFE_RTortho The_TypeOfFE_RTortho;\n    static AddNewFE(\"RT0Ortho\", The_TypeOfFE_RTortho);\n} //FEM2d namespace\n\n\nTry with ./load.link command in examples++-load/ and see BernardiRaugel.cpp or Morley.cpp new finite element examples.\nOtherwise with static link (for expert only), add\n//let the 2 globals variables\nstatic TypeOfFE_RTortho The_TypeOfFE_RTortho;\n//the name in freefem\nstatic ListOfTFE typefemRTOrtho(\"RT0Ortho\", &The_TypeOfFE_RTortho);\n\n//link with FreeFem++ do not work with static library .a\n//so add a extern name to call in init_static_FE\n//(see end of FESpace.cpp)\nvoid init_FE_ADD() { };\n//end\n} //FEM2d namespace\n\n\nTo inforce in loading of this new finite element, we have to add the two new lines close to the end of files src/femlib/FESpace.cpp like:\n//correct problem of static library link with new make file\nvoid init_static_FE()\n{ //list of other FE file.o\n    extern void init_FE_P2h() ;\n    init_FE_P2h() ;\n    extern void init_FE_ADD(); //new line 1\n    init_FE_ADD(); //new line 2\n}\n\n\nand now you have to change the makefile.\nFirst, create a file FE_ADD.cpp contening all this code, like in file src/femlib/Element_P2h.cpp, after modify the Makefile.am by adding the name of your file to the variable EXTRA_DIST like:\n# Makefile using Automake + Autoconf\n# ----------------------------------\n# Id\n\n# This is not compiled as a separate

project an remove the flag in panal PPC linker FreeFm++ Setting Dead-strip Static Initializition Code Flag.\n\n\n\nDynamical link¶\nNow, it’s possible to add built-in functionnalites in FreeFem++ under the three environnents Linux, Windows and MacOS X 10.3 or newer.\nIt is agood idea to first try the example load.edp in directory example++-load.\nYou will need to install a compiler (generally g++/gcc compiler) to compile your function.\n\nWindows Install the cygwin environnent or the mingw one\nMacOs Install the developer tools Xcode on the apple DVD\nLinux/Unix Install the correct compiler (gcc for instance)\n\nNow, assume that you are in a shell window (a cygwin window under Windows) in the directory example++-load.\n\nNote\nIn the sub directory include, they are all the FreeFem++ include file to make the link with FreeFem++.\n\n\nNote\nIf you try to load dynamically a file with command load \"xxx\"\n- Under Unix (Linux or MacOs), the file xxx.so will be loaded so it must be either in the search directory of routine dlopen (see the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. or in the current directory, and the suffix \".so\" or the prefix \"./\" is automatically added.\n\nUnder Windows, the file xxx.dll will be loaded so it must be in the loadLibary search directory which includes the directory of the application,\n\n\nCompilation of your module:\nThe script ff-c++ compiles and makes the link with FreeFem++, but be careful, the script has no way to known if you try to compile for a pure Windows environment or for a cygwin environment so to build the load module under cygwin you must add the -cygwin parameter.\n\nA first example myfunction.cpp¶\nThe following defines a new function call myfunction with no parameter, but using the \\(x,y\\) current value.\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cfloat>\nusing namespace std;\n#include \"error.hpp\"\n#include \"AFunction.hpp\"\n#include \"rgraph.hpp\"\n#include \"RNM.hpp\"\n#include \"fem.hpp\"\n#include \"FESpace.hpp\"\n#include \"MeshPoint.hpp\"\n\nusing namespace Fem2D;\ndouble myfunction(Stack stack){\n    //to get FreeFem++ data\n    MeshPoint &mp = *MeshPointStack(stack); //the struct to get x, y, normal, value\n    double x = mp.P.x; //get the current x value\n    double y = mp.P.y; //get the current y value\n    //cout << \"x = \" << x << \" y=\" << y << endl;\n    return sin(x)*cos(y);\n}\n\n\nNow the Problem is to build the link with FreeFem++, to do that we need two classes, one to call the function myfunction.\nAll FreeFem++ evaluable expression must be a C++ struct/class which derivate from E_F0.\nBy default this expression does not depend of the mesh position, but if they derivate from E_F0mps the expression depends of the mesh position, and for more details see [HECHT2002].\n//A class build the link with FreeFem++\n//generaly this class are already in AFunction.hpp\n//but unfortunatly, I have no simple function with no parameter\n//in FreeFem++ depending of the mesh\ntemplate<class R>\nclass OneOperator0s : public OneOperator {\n    //the class to define and evaluate a new function\n    //It must devive from E_F0 if it is mesh independent\n    //or from E_F0mps if it is mesh dependent\n    class E_F0_F :public E_F0mps {\n    public:\n        typedef R (*func)(Stack stack);\n        func f; //the pointeur to the fnction myfunction\n        E_F0_F(func ff) : f(ff) {}\n        //the operator evaluation in FreeFem++\n        AnyType operator()(Stack stack) const {return SetAny<R>(f(stack));}\n    };\n    typedef R (*func)(Stack);\n    func f;\n    public:\n        //the function which build the FreeFem++ byte code\n        E_F0 *code(const basicAC_F0 &) const { return new E_F0_F(f); }\n        //the constructor to say ff is a function without parameter\n        //and returning a R\n        OneOperator0s(func ff) : OneOperator(map_type[typeid(R).name()]),f(ff){}\n};\n\n\nTo finish we must add this new function in FreeFem++ table, to do that include :\nvoid init(){\n    Global.Add(\"myfunction\", \"(\", new OneOperator0s<double>(myfunction));\n}\nLOADFUNC(init);\n\n\nIt will be called automatically at load module time.\nTo compile and link, use the ff-c++ script :\nff-c++ myfunction.cpp\ng++ -c -g -Iinclude myfunction.cpp\ng++ -bundle -undefined dynamic_lookup -g myfunction.o -o ./myfunction.dylib\n\n\nTo try the simple example under Linux or MacOS, do FreeFem++-nw load.edp\nThe output must be:\n-- FreeFem++ v  *.****** (date *** ** *** ****, **:**:** (UTC+0*00))\n Load: lg_fem lg_mesh lg_mesh3 eigenvalue\n    1 : // Example

To download and install under download/include just go in download/fftw and try make.\nThe 1D dfft (fast discret fourier transform) for a simple array \\(f\\) of size \\(n\\) is defined by the following formula:\n\n\\[\\mathtt{dfft}(f,\\varepsilon)_{k} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f_i e^{\\varepsilon 2\\pi i kj/n}\\]\nThe 2D DFFT for an array of size \\(N=n\\times m\\) is:\n\n\\[\\mathtt{dfft}(f,m,\\varepsilon)_{k+nl} = \\sum_{j'=0}^{m-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} f_{i+nj} e^{\\varepsilon 2\\pi i (kj/n+lj'/m) }\\]\n\nNote\nThe value \\(n\\) is given by \\(size(f)/m\\), and the numbering is row-major order.\n\nSo the classical discrete DFFT is \\(\\hat{f}=\\mathtt{dfft}(f,-1)/\\sqrt{n}\\) and the reverse dFFT \\(f=\\mathtt{dfft}(\\hat{f},1)/\\sqrt{n}\\)\n\nNote\nThe 2D Laplace operator is\n\n\n\\[f(x,y) = 1/\\sqrt{N} \\sum_{j'=0}^{m-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\hat{f}_{i+nj} e^{\\varepsilon 2\\pi i (x j+ yj') }\\]\nand we have\n\n\\[f_{k+nl} = f(k/n,l/m)\\]\nSo\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\widehat{\\Delta f_{kl}} = -( (2\\pi)^2 ( (\\tilde{k})^2+(\\tilde{l})^2)) \\widehat{ f_{kl}} \\\\\\end{split}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{k} = k\\) if \\(k \\leq n/2\\) else \\(\\tilde{k} = k-n\\) and \\(\\tilde{l} = l\\) if \\(l \\leq m/2\\) else \\(\\tilde{l} = l-m\\).\n\nAnd to have a real function we need all modes to be symmetric around zero, so \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) must be odd.\n\nCompile to build a new library\nff-c++ dfft.cpp ../download/install/lib/libfftw3.a -I../download/install/include\nexport MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3\ng++ -c -Iinclude

long maturing process, freefem, in its last avatar, FreeFem++ , is a high level integrated development environment (IDE) for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDE) in dimension 2 and 3.\nIt is the ideal tool for teaching the finite element method but it is also perfect for research to quickly test new ideas or multi-physics and complex applications.\nFreeFem++ has an advanced automatic mesh generator, capable of a posteriori mesh adaptation; it has a general purpose elliptic solver interfaced with fast algorithms, such as the multi-frontal method UMFPACK, SuperLU, MUMPS.\nHyperbolic and parabolic problems are solved by iterative algorithms prescribed by the user with the high level language of FreeFem++.\nIt has several triangular finite elements, including discontinuous elements.\nEverything is there in FreeFem++ to prepare research quality reports with online color display, zooming and other features as well as postscript printouts.\nThis manual is meant for students at a Masters level, for researchers at any level, and for engineers (including financial engineering) with some understanding of variational methods for partial differential equations.\n\nIntroduction¶\nA partial differential equation is a relation between a function of several variables and its (partial) derivatives.\nMany problems in physics, engineering, mathematics and even banking are modeled by one or several partial differential equations.\nFreeFem++ is a software to solve these equations numerically.\nAs its name implies, it is a free software (see the copyrights for full detail) based on the Finite Element Method; it is not a package, it is an integrated product with its own high level programming language.\nThis software runs on all UNIX OS (with g++ 3.3 or later, and OpenGL), on Window XP, Vista and 7, 8, 10 and on MacOS 10 intel.\nMoreover FreeFem++ is highly adaptive.\nMany phenomena involve several coupled systems.\nFluid-structure interactions, Lorentz forces for aluminum casting and ocean-atmosphere problems are three such systems.\nThese require different finite element approximations and polynomial degrees, possibly on different meshes.\nSome algorithms like the Schwarz’ domain decomposition method also requires data interpolation on multiple meshes within one program.\nFreeFem++ can handle these difficulties, i.e. arbitrary finite element spaces on arbitrary unstructured and adapted bi-dimensional meshes.\nThe characteristics of FreeFem++ are:\n\nProblem description (real or complex valued) by their variational formulations, with access to the internal vectors and matrices if needed.\nMulti-variables, multi-equations, bi-dimensional and three-dimensional static or time dependent, linear or nonlinear coupled systems; however the user is required to describe the iterative procedures which reduce the problem to a set of linear problems.\nEasy geometric input by analytic description of boundaries by pieces; however this part is not a CAD system; for instance when two boundaries intersect, the user must specify the intersection points.\nAutomatic mesh generator, based on the Delaunay-Voronoi algorithm; the inner point density is proportional to the density of points on the boundaries [GEORGE1996].\nMetric-based anisotropic mesh adaptation.\nThe metric can be computed automatically from the Hessian of any FreeFem++ function [HECHT1998].\nHigh level user friendly typed input language with an algebra of analytic and finite element functions.\nMultiple finite element meshes within one application with automatic interpolation of data on different meshes and possible storage of the interpolation matrices.\nA large variety of triangular finite elements: linear, quadratic Lagrangian elements and more, discontinuous P1 and Raviart-Thomas elements, elements of a non-scalar type, the mini-element,… (but no quadrangles).\nTools to define discontinuous Galerkin finite element formulations P0, P1dc, P2dc and keywords: jump, mean, intalledges.\nA large variety of linear direct and iterative solvers (LU, Cholesky, Crout, CG, GMRES, UMFPACK, MUMPS, SuperLU, …) and eigenvalue and eigenvector solvers (ARPARK) .\nNear optimal execution speed (compared with compiled C++ implementations programmed directly).\nOnline graphics, generation of ,.txt,.eps,.gnu, mesh files for further manipulations of input and output data.\nMany examples and tutorials: elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems, Navier-Stokes flows, elasticity, fluid structure interactions, Schwarz’s domain decomposition method, eigenvalue problem, residual error indicator, …\nA parallel version using MPI\n\n\n\nHistory¶\nThe project has evolved from MacFem, PCfem, written in Pascal.\nThe first C version lead to freefem 3.4; it offered mesh adaptivity on a single mesh only.\nA thorough rewriting in C++ led to freefem+ (freefem+ 1.2.10 was its last release), which included interpolation over multiple meshes (functions defined on one mesh can be used on any other mesh); this software is no longer maintained but is still in use because it handles a problem description using the strong form of the PDEs.\nImplementing the interpolation from one unstructured mesh to another was not easy because it had to be fast and non-diffusive; for each point, one had to find the containing triangle.\nThis is one of the basic problems of computational geometry (see [PREPARATA1985] for example).\nDoing it in a minimum number of operations was the challenge.\nOur implementation is \\(\\mathcal{O}(n log n)\\) and based on a quadtree.\nThis version also grew out of hand because of the evolution of the template syntax in C++.\nWe have been working for a few years now on FreeFem++ , entirely re-written again in C++ with a thorough usage of template and generic programming for coupled systems of unknown size at compile time.\nLike all versions of freefem, it has a high level user friendly input language which is not too far from the mathematical writing of the problems.\nThe freefem language allows for a quick specification of any partial differential system of equations.\nThe language syntax of FreeFem++ is the result of a new design which makes use of the STL [STROUSTRUP2000], templates, and bison for its implementation; more details can be found in [HECHT2002].\nThe outcome is a versatile software in which any new finite elements can be included in a few hours; but a recompilation is then necessary.\nTherefore the library of finite elements available in FreeFem++ will grow with the version number and with the number of users who program more new elements.\nSo far we have discontinuous \\(P_0\\) elements,linear \\(P_1\\) and quadratic \\(P_2\\) Lagrangian elements, discontinuous \\(P_1\\) and Raviart-Thomas elements and a few others like bubble elements.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++

decomposition previously created with prefix prmesh.\nscalar determines the type of data for this finite element: real or complex.\n\nTwo macros, def and init, are needed: def specifies how to define

this builds the necessary distributed operators associated to the finite element space: the local partition of unity functions \\((D_i)_{i=1,...,N}\\) (see pr#Dk and pr#Dih below) as well as the function pr#update (see below) which synchronizes local vectors \\((u_i)_{i=1,...,N}\\) between neighboring subdomains, performing the equivalent of \\(u_i = R_i (\\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T u_j)\\) or \\(u_i

variational problem given by Varf, on top of the distributed finite element space prfe.This will create and expose variables whose names will be prefixed by pr, see below.\nIt is assumed that ffddmbuildDfespace has already been called with prefix prfe in order to define the distributed finite element space.\n\n\n\nIn practice, this builds the so-called local ‘Dirichlet’ matrices \\(A_i = R_i A R_i^T\\), the restrictions of the global operator \\(A\\) to the subdomains (see pr#aRdbelow).The matrices correspond to the discretization of the bilinear form given by the macro Varf, which represents the abstract variational form of the problem.\nThese matrices are then used to implement the action of the global operator \\(A\\) on a local vector (the parallel matrix-vector product with \\(A\\)), see pr#A below.\n\n\n\nAt this point, we already have the necessary data to be able to solve the problem with a parallel direct solver (MUMPS), which is the purpose of the function pr#directsolve (see below).See ffddmbuildrhs for building the right-hand side.\n\n\n\nThe macro Varf is required to have three parameters: the name of the variational form, the mesh, and the finite element space.\nThe variational form given in this ‘abstract’ format will then be used by ffddm to assemble the discrete operators by setting the appropriate mesh and finite element space as parameters.\nAn example is given below:\nmacro myVarf(varfName, meshName, VhName)\n    varf varfName(u,v) = int3d(meshName)(grad(u)''* grad(v)) + on(1, u = 1.0);\n// EOM\n\nffddmsetupOperator(myprefix,myFEprefix,myVarf)\n\n\nRemark In this simple example, the third parameter VhName is not used.\nHowever, for more complex cases such as non-linear or time dependent problems where the problem depends on a solution computed at a previous step, it is useful to know for which discrete finite element space the variational form is being used.\nSee for example

standard parallel case, only the local matrix for this mpi rank pr#aRd[mpiRank(prmesh#commddm)] is defined (unless this mpi rank is excluded from the spatial domain decomposition, i. e. prmesh#excluded = 1).\nIn the sequential case, all local matrices are defined.\n\n\n\nfunc prfe#K[int] pr#A(prfe#K[int] &ui) The function pr#A computes the parallel matrix-vector product, i.e. the action of the global operator \\(A\\) on the local vector \\(u_i\\).The computation is equivalent to \\(R_i (\\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T D_j A_j u_j)\\) and is performed in parallel using local matrices pr#aRd and the function prfe#update.\nIn the sequential case, the global matrix pr#Aglobal is used instead.\n\n\n\nfunc prfe#K[int] pr#directsolve(prfe#K[int]& rhsi) The function pr#directsolve allows to solve the linear system \\(A x = b\\) in parallel using the parallel direct solver MUMPS.The matrix is given to MUMPS in distributed form through the local matrices pr#aRd.\nThe input rhsi is given as a distributed vector (rhsi is the restriction of the global right-hand side \\(b\\) to the subdomain of this mpi rank, see ffddmbuildrhs) and the returned vector is local as well.\n\n\n\n\nffddmbuildrhs(pr,Varfrhs,rhs)\n\n\n\n\nbuilds the right-hand side associated to the variational form given by Varfrhs for the problem corresponding to prefix pr.The resulting right-hand

macro).\n\n\n\nThe input vector rhs is resized and contains the resulting local right-hand side \\(R_i b\\), the restriction of the global right-hand side \\(b\\) to the subdomain of this mpi rank.In the sequential case, the global right-hand side vector \\(b\\) is assembled instead.\n\n\nAn example is given below:\n\nmacro myVarfrhs(varfName, meshName, VhName)\n    varf varfName(u,v) =

level preconditioner for problem pr.This will create and expose variables whose names will be prefixed by pr, see below.\nIt is assumed that ffddmsetupOperator has already been called with prefix pr in order to define the problem to solve.\n\n\n\nIn practice, this builds and performs the factorization of the local matrices used in the one level preconditioner.The local matrices depend on the choice of ffddmprecond and VarfPrec, see pr#aRbelow.\n\n\n\ndefines:\n\n\nstring pr#prec equal to ffddmprecond.Sets the type of one level preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_1\\) to be used: “asm” (Additive

preconditioner).\n\n\n\nmatrix<pr#prfe#K>[int] pr#aR array (size prfe#prmesh#npart) of local matrices used for the one level preconditioner.Each mpi rank of the spatial domain decomposition performs the \\(LU\\) (or \\(LDL^T\\)) factorization of the local matrix corresponding to its subdomain using the direct solver MUMPS.\n\nIf VarfPrec is not a previously defined macro (just put null for example), the matrices pr#aR are set to be equal to the so-called local ‘Dirichlet’ matrices pr#aRd (see ffddmsetupOperator).This is for the classical ASM preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_1 = M^{-1}_{\\text{ASM}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T A_i^{-1} R_i\\) or classical RAS preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_1 = M^{-1}_{\\text{RAS}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T D_i A_i^{-1} R_i\\) (it is assumed that ffddmprecond is equal to “asm” or “ras”).\n\n\nIf VarfPrec is a macro, it is assumed that VarfPrec defines an abstract bilinear form (see ffddmsetupOperator for more details on how to define the abstract variational form as a macro).\n\nIf ffddmprecond is equal to “asm” or “ras”, the matrices pr#aR will be assembled as local ‘Dirichlet’ matrices in the same manner as pr#aRd, but using the bilinear form defined by VarfPrec instead.This defines the ASM preconditioner as \\(M^{-1}_1 = M^{-1}_{\\text{ASM}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T {(A_i^{\\text{Prec}})}^{-1} R_i\\) and the RAS preconditioner as \\(M^{-1}_1 = M^{-1}_{\\text{RAS}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T D_i {(A_i^{\\text{Prec}})}^{-1} R_i\\), where \\(A_i^{\\text{Prec}} = R_i A^{\\text{Prec}} R_i^T\\).\n\n\n\nIf ffddmprecond is equal to “oras” or “soras”, the matrices pr#aR will correspond to the discretization of the variational form VarfPrec in the subdomains \\(\\Omega_i\\).In particular, various boundary conditions can be imposed at the interface between subdomains (corresponding to mesh boundary of label ffddminterfacelabel set by the parent call to ffddmbuildDmesh), such as Optimized Robin boundary conditions.\nWe note the ORAS preconditioner as \\(M^{-1}_1 = M^{-1}_{\\text{ORAS}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T D_i {(B_i^{\\text{Prec}})}^{-1} R_i\\) and the SORAS preconditioner as \\(M^{-1}_1 = M^{-1}_{\\text{SORAS}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N

preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_1\\), i.e. the action of \\(M^{-1}_1\\) on the local vector \\(u_i\\).In the sequential case, it computes the action of \\(M^{-1}_1\\) on a global vector.\nThe action of the inverse of local matrices pr#aRd is computed by forward-backward substitution using their \\(LU\\) (or \\(LDL^T\\)) decomposition.\n\n\n\nfunc pr#prfe#K[int] pr#PREC(pr#prfe#K[int] &ui) The function pr#PREC corresponds to the action of the preconditioner \\(M^{-1}\\) for problem pr.It coincides with the one level preconditioner pr#PREC1 after the call to ffddmsetupPrecond.\nIf a second level is subsequently added (see the next section about Two level preconditioners), it will then coincide with the two level preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_2\\) (see pr#PREC2level).\n\n\n\nfunc pr#prfe#K[int] pr#fGMRES(pr#prfe#K[int]& x0i, pr#prfe#K[int]& bi, real eps, int nbiter, string sprec) The function pr#fGMRES allows to solve the linear system \\(A x = b\\) in parallel using the flexible GMRES method preconditioned by \\(M^{-1}\\).The action of the global operator \\(A\\) is given by pr#A, the action of the preconditioner \\(M^{-1}\\) is given by pr#PREC and the scalar products are computed by pr#scalprod.\nMore details are given in the section Solving the linear system.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo level preconditioners¶\n\nThe main ingredient of a two level preconditioner is the so-called ‘coarse space’ matrix \\(Z\\).\n\n\\(Z\\) is a rectangular matrix of size \\(n \\times n_c\\), where usually \\(n_c \\ll n\\).\n\n\n\\(Z\\) is used to build the ‘coarse space operator’ \\(E = Z^T A Z\\), a square matrix of size \\(n_c \\times n_c\\).We can then define the ‘coarse space correction operator’ \\(Q = Z E^{-1} Z^T = Z (Z^T A Z)^{-1} Z^T\\), which can then be used to enrich the one level preconditioner through a correction formula.\nThe simplest one is the additive coarse correction: \\(M^{-1}_2 = M^{-1}_1 + Q\\).\nSee pr#corr below for all other available correction formulas.\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways to define a relevant coarse space \\(Z\\) for different classes of problems.ffddmgeneosetup defines a coarse space correction operator by building the GenEO coarse space, while ffddmcoarsemeshsetup builds the coarse space using a coarse mesh.\n\n\n\nAfter a call to either ffddmgeneosetup or ffddmcoarsemeshsetup, the following variables and functions are set up:\n\n\nint pr#ncoarsespace the size of the coarse space \\(n_c\\).\n\nstring pr#corr initialized with the value of ffddmcorrection.Specifies the type of coarse correction formula to use for the two level preconditioner.\nThe possible values are:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{align*}\n\\nonumber\n&&\\text{\"AD\"}:&&\\textit{Additive}, \\quad &M^{-1} = M^{-1}_2 = \\phantom{(I - Q A) }M^{-1}_1\\phantom{ (I - A Q)} + Q\\\\\n&&\\text{\"BNN\"}:&&\\textit{Balancing Neumann-Neumann}, \\quad &M^{-1} = M^{-1}_2 = (I - Q A) M^{-1}_1 (I - A Q) +

\\quad &M^{-1} = M^{-1}_2 = \\phantom{(I - Q A) }M^{-1}_1\\phantom{ (I - A Q)}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\\end{split}\\]\nNote that AD, ADEF1 and RBNN2 only require one application of \\(Q\\), while BNN, ADEF2 and RBNN1 require two.\nThe default coarse correction is ADEF1, which is cheaper and generally as robust as BNN or ADEF2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunc pr#prfe#K[int] pr#Q(pr#prfe#K[int] &ui) The function pr#Q computes the parallel application of the coarse correction operator \\(Q\\), i.e. the action of \\(Q = Z E^{-1} Z^T\\) on the local vector \\(u_i\\).In the sequential case, it computes the action of \\(Q\\) on a global vector.\nThe implementation differs depending on the method used to build the coarse space (with GenEO or using a coarse mesh), but the idea is the same: the action of the transpose of the distributed operator \\(Z\\) on the distributed vector \\(u_i\\) is computed in parallel, with the contribution of all subdomains being gathered in a vector of size \\(n_c\\) in the mpi process of rank 0.\nThe action of the inverse of the coarse space operator \\(E\\) is then computed by forward-backward substitution using its \\(LU\\) (or \\(LDL^T\\)) decomposition previously computed by the first pr#prfe#prmesh#pCS ranks of the mpi communicator.\nThe result is then sent back to all subdomains to perform the last application of \\(Z\\) and obtain the resulting local vector in each subdomain.\n\n\n\n\nfunc pr#prfe#K[int] pr#PREC2level(pr#prfe#K[int] &ui) The function pr#PREC2level computes the parallel application of the two level preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_2\\), i.e. the action of \\(M^{-1}_2\\) on the local vector \\(u_i\\).In the sequential case, it computes the action of \\(M^{-1}_2\\) on a global vector.\nThe two level preconditioner depends on the choice of the coarse correction formula which is determined by pr#corr, see above.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the GenEO coarse space¶\nffddmgeneosetup(pr,Varf)\n\n\nThis builds the GenEO coarse space for problem pr.\nThis will create and expose variables whose names will be prefixed by pr, see below.\nIt is assumed that ffddmsetupPrecond has already been called for prefix pr in order to define the one level preconditioner for problem pr.\nThe GenEO coarse space is \\(Z = (R_i^T D_i V_{i,k})^{i=1,...,N}_{\\lambda_{i,k} \\ge \\tau}\\), where \\(V_{i,k}\\) are eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{i,k}\\) of the following local generalized eigenvalue problem in subdomain \\(i\\):\n\\(D_i A_i D_i V_{i,k} = \\lambda_{i,k} A_i^{\\text{Neu}} V_{i,k}\\),\n\nwhere \\(A_i^{\\text{Neu}}\\) is the local Neumann matrix of subdomain \\(i\\) (with Neumann boundary conditions at the subdomain interface).\n\nIn practice, this builds and factorizes the local Neumann matrices \\(A_i^{\\text{Neu}}\\) corresponding to the abstract bilinear form given by the macro Varf (see ffddmsetupOperator for more details on how to define the abstract variational form as a macro).In the GenEO method, the abstract bilinear form Varf is assumed to be the same as the one used to define the problem pr through the previous call to ffddmsetupOperator.\nThe local generalized eigenvalue problem is then solved in each subdomain to find the eigenvectors \\(V_{i,k}\\) corresponding to the largest eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{i,k}\\) (see pr#Z below).\nThe number of computed eigenvectors \\(\\nu\\) is given by ffddmnu.\nThe eigenvectors selected to enter \\(Z\\) correspond to eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{i,k}\\) larger than \\(\\tau\\), where the threshold parameter \\(\\tau\\) is given by ffddmtau.\nIf ffddmtau \\(= 0\\), all ffddmnu eigenvectors are selected.\nFinally, the coarse space operator \\(E = Z^T A Z\\) is assembled and factorized (see pr#E below).\n\n\n\ndefines:\n\n\npr#prfe#K[int][int] pr#Z array of local eigenvectors \\(Z_{i,k} = D_i V_{i,k}\\) obtained by solving the local generalized eigenvalue problem above in

communicator, with mpi rank 0 as the master process.\nThe number of mpi processes dedicated to the coarse problem is set by the underlying mesh decomposition of problem pr, which also specifies if these mpi ranks are excluded from the spatial decomposition or not.\nThese parameters are set by ffddmpCS and ffddmexclude when calling ffddmbuildDmesh (see ffddmbuildDmesh for more details).\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the coarse space from a coarse mesh¶\nffddmcoarsemeshsetup(pr,Thc,VarfEprec,VarfAprec)\n\n\n\n\nbuilds the coarse space for problem pr from a coarse problem which corresponds to the discretization of a variational form on a coarser mesh Thc of \\(\\Omega\\).This will create and expose variables whose names will be prefixed by pr, see below.\nIt is assumed that ffddmsetupPrecond has already been called for prefix pr in order to define the one level preconditioner for problem pr.\nThe abstract variational form for the coarse problem can differ from the original problem pr and is given by macro VarfEprec (see ffddmsetupOperator for more details on how to define the abstract variational form as a macro).\nFor example, absorption can be added in the preconditioner for wave propagation problems, see examples for Helmholtz and Maxwell equations in the Examples section.\n\n\n\nThe coarse space \\(Z\\) corresponds to the interpolation operator from the coarse finite element space to the original finite element space of the problem.Thus, the coarse space operator \\(E = Z^T A^{\\text{Eprec}} Z\\) corresponds to the matrix of the problem given by VarfEprec discretized on the coarse mesh Thc and is assembled as such.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, VarfAprec specifies the global operator involved in multiplicative coarse correction formulas.For example, \\(M^{-1}_{2,\\text{ADEF1}} = M^{-1}_1 (I - A^{\\text{Aprec}} Q) + Q\\) (where \\(Q = Z E^{-1} Z^T\\)).\n\\(A^{\\text{Aprec}}\\) defaults to \\(A\\) if VarfAprec is not a valid macro (you can put null

?¶\nIn the acronym ffddm, ff stands for FreeFem++ and ddm for domain decomposition methods.\nThe idea behind ffddm is to simplify the use of parallel solvers in FreeFem++: distributed direct methods and domain decomposition methods.\nParallelism is an important issue because, since about 2004, the clock speed of cores stagnates at 2-3 GHz.\nThe increase in performance is almost entirely due to the increase in the number of cores per processor.\nAll major processor vendors are producing multicore chips and now every machine is a parallel machine.\nWaiting for the next generation machine does not guarantee anymore a better performance of a software.\nTo keep doubling performance parallelism must double.\nIt implies a huge effort in algorithmic development.\nThanks to ffddm, FreeFem++ users have access to high-level functionalities for specifying and solving their finite element problems in parallel.\nThe first task handled by ffddm is the data distribution among the processors.\nThis is done via an overlapping domain decomposition and a related distributed linear algebra.\nThen, solving a linear system is possible either via an interface to the parallel MUMPS solver or by using domain decomposition methods as preconditioners to the GMRES Krylov method.\nThe ffddm framework makes it easy to use scalable Schwarz methods enhanced by a coarse space correction built either from a coarse mesh or a GenEO (Generalized Eigenvalue in the Overlap) coarse space, see also the book An Introduction to Domain Decomposition Methods: algorithms, theory, and parallel implementation.\nState-of-the-art three level methods are also implemented in ffddm.\nThe ffddm framework is entirely written in the FreeFem++ language and the ‘.idp’ scripts can be found here.\nIt makes it also a very good tool for learning and prototyping domain decomposition methods without compromising efficiency.\nffddm can also act as a wrapper for the HPDDM library.\nHPDDM is an efficient implementation of various domain decomposition methods and a variety of Krylov subspace algorithms, with advanced block and recycling methods for solving sequences of linear systems with multiple right-hand sides: GMRES and Block GMRES, CG, Block CG, and Breakdown-Free Block CG, GCRO-DR and Block GCRO-DR.\nFor more details on how to use HPDDM within ffddm, see the ffddm documentation.\n\nGetting Started¶\n\nMinimal Example¶\nmacro dimension 2// EOM            // 2D or 3D\ninclude \"ffddm.idp\"\nmesh Th = square(50,50);    // global mesh\n// Step 1: Decompose the

among several processors especially for solving linear systems.\nA natural way is to do it via domain decomposition.\n\nMesh Decomposition¶\nThe starting point is a collection of \\(N\\) sub-meshes \\((Th_i)_{i=1}^N\\) that together form a global mesh\n\n\\[Th:= \\cup_{i=1}^N Th_i\\,.\\]\nThis induces a natural decomposition of the global finite element space \\(Vh\\) on \\(Th\\) into \\(N\\) local finite element spaces \\((Vh_i)_{i=1}^N\\) each of them defined on \\(Th_i\\).\nNote By global, we mean that the corresponding structure can be refered to in the code (most often only) by its local values.\nIn computer science term, it corresponds to a distributed data where each piece of data is stored by a MPI process.\n\n\nDistributed Linear Algebra¶\nThe domain decomposition induces a natural decomposition of the set of the global degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) \\({\\mathcal N}\\) of the finite element space \\(Vh\\) into the \\(N\\) subsets of d.o.f.’s \\(({\\mathcal N})_{i=1}^N\\) each associated with the local finite element space \\(Vh_i\\).\nWe have thus\n\n\\[{\\mathcal N} = \\cup_{i=1}^N {\\mathcal N}_i\\,,\\]\nbut with duplications of some of the d.o.f.’s.\nAssociated with this decomposition of the set of d.o.f.’s \\({\\mathcal N}\\), a distributed vector is a collection of local vectors \\(({\\mathbf V_i}_{1\\le i\\le N})\\) so that the values on the duplicated d.o.f.’s are the same.\n\nNote\nIn mathematical terms, it can be described as follows for a real valued problem.\nFor a real value problem, simply replace \\(\\R\\) with \\(\\C\\).\nLet \\(R_i\\) be the restriction operator from \\(\\R^{\\#{\\mathcal N}}\\) to \\(\\R^{\\#{\\mathcal N}_i}\\), where \\(\\#{\\mathcal N}_i\\) denotes the number of elements of \\({\\mathcal N}_i\\).\nA collection of local vectors \\(({\\mathbf V}_i)_{1\\le i\\le N}\\in \\Pi_{i=1}^N \\R^{\\#{\\mathcal N}_i}\\) is a distributed vector iff there exists a global vector \\({\\mathbf V}\\in\\R^{\\#{\\mathcal N}}\\) such that for all subset \\(1\\le i\\le N\\), we have:\n\n\\[{\\mathbf V}_i = R_i\\,{\\mathbf V}\\,.\\]\nWe will also say that the collection of local vectors \\(({\\mathbf V}_i)_{1\\le i\\le N}\\) is consistent.\n\n\n\nPartition of Unity Matrices (POUM)¶\nLet \\((D_i)_{1\\le i \\le N}\\) be square diagonal matrices of size \\(\\#{\\mathcal N}_i\\) which form a partition of unity in the sense that:\n\n\\[Id_{} = \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T\\,D_i\\,R_i\\text{ in }\\R^{\\#{\\mathcal N}\\times \\#{\\mathcal N}} \\,.\\]\nFor instance if a degree of freedom is shared by \\(k\\) subdomains defining the corresponding entry of the diagonal matrix \\(D\\) to be \\(1/k\\) yields partition of unity matrices.\nThe matrices \\(R_i\\) and \\(D_i\\) are the heart of distributed linear algebra.\n\nDistributed scalar product¶\nFor two global vectors \\({\\mathbf U}\\) and \\({\\mathbf V}\\) of size \\(\\#{\\mathcal N}\\), the formula for the scalar product \\({\\mathbf V}^T\\,{\\mathbf U}=({\\mathbf U},\\,{\\mathbf V})\\) in terms of their distributed vector counterparts is:\n\n\\[({\\mathbf U}, {\\mathbf V}) = \\left({\\mathbf U}, \\sum_{i=1}^N R_i^T D_i R_i {\\mathbf V}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^N(R_i {\\mathbf U}, D_i R_i {\\mathbf V})\n=\\sum_{i=1}^N\\left({\\mathbf U}_i, D_i {\\mathbf V}_i\\right)\\,.\\]\nLocal scalar products are performed concurrently.\nThus, the implementation is parallel except for the sum which corresponds to a MPI_Reduce call across the \\(N\\) MPI processes.\nNote also that the implementation relies on the knowledge of a partition of unity so that the FreeFem++ syntax is dscalprod(Di,u,v) or equivalently pr#scalprod(u,v) where pr is a user defined prefix that refers to the domain decomposition and thus implicitely also to the partition of unity.\n\n\nUpdate¶\nFrom a collection of local vectors \\(({\\mathbf U}_i)_{1\\le i \\le N}\\), it is possible ensure consistency of the duplicated data and thus creating a distributed vector \\(({\\mathbf V}_i)_{1\\le i \\le N}\\) by calling the function pr#update(Ui, TRUE) where pr is a user defined prefix that refers to the domain decomposition.\nThis function performs the following operation for all \\(1\\le i \\le N\\):\n\n\\[{\\mathbf V}_i \\leftarrow R_i\\, \\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T D_j {\\mathbf U}_j\\]\n\nNote\nThe implementation corresponds to\n\n\\[{\\mathbf V}_i := R_i \\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T D_j {\\mathbf U}_j = D_i {\\mathbf U}_i + \\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal{O}(i)} R_i\\,R_j^T\\,D_j {\\mathbf U}_j\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathcal{O}(i)\\) is the set of neighbors of subdomain \\(i\\).\nTherefore, the matrix vector product is computed in three steps: - concurrent computing of \\(D_j {\\mathbf U}_j\\) for all \\(1\\le j\\le N\\); - neighbor to neighbor MPI-communications (\\(R_i\\,R_j^T\\)) ; - concurrent sum of neighbor contributions.\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Matrix and Vector resulting from a variational formulation¶\nThe discretization of a variational formulation on the global mesh \\(Th\\) yields a global matrix \\(A\\) and a global right hand side \\(\\mathbf{RHS}\\).\nThanks to the sparsity of finite element matrices for partial differential equations and thanks to the overlap between subdomains, the knowledge of the local matrix \\(R_i A R_i^T\\) on each subdomain \\(1\\le i\\le N\\) is sufficient to perform the matrix-vector product \\(A\\times \\mathbf{U}\\) for any global vector \\(\\mathbf{U}\\).\nOnce the problem has been set up by a call to ffddmsetupOperator(myprefix,myFEprefix,myVarf), the matrix-vector product is performed by calling the function pr#A(Ui) where pr is a user defined prefix that refers to the problem at hand which itself implicitly refers to the triplet (domain decomposition, finite element, variational formulation).\nSee more on problem defintion in this documentation and more on distributed linear algebra in chapter 8 of “An Introduction to Domain Decomposition Methods: algorithms, theory and parallel implementation” SIAM 2015.\n\n\nDistributed Linear Solvers¶\nIn many cases, we are interested in the solution of the problem in terms of the vector of d.o.f.’s \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) that satisfies:\n\n\\[A\\, \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{RHS}\\,.\\]\nffddm offers two parallel solvers: direct factorization and Schwarz domain decomposition methods.\n\nDistributed Direct Solvers¶\nIn order to benefit from the sparsity of the matrix arising from a finite element discretization of a partial differential equation, a variant of Gauss elimination, the frontal method, that automatically avoids a large number of operations involving zero terms was developed.\nA frontal solver builds a \\(LU\\) or Cholesky decomposition of a sparse matrix given as the assembly of element matrices by eliminating equations only on a subset of elements at a time.\nThis subset is called the front and it is essentially the transition region between the part of the system already finished and the part not touched yet.\nThese methods are basically sequential since the unknowns are processed the one after another or one front after another.\nIn order to benefit from multicore processors, a multifrontal solver is an improvement of the frontal solver that uses several independent fronts at the same time.\nThe fronts can be worked on by different processors, which enables parallel computing. ffddm provides an interface to the parallel sparse direct solver MUMPS.\n\n\nSchwarz methods¶\nWe consider the solve of the equation \\(A\\, \\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{RHS}\\) by a flexible GMRES method preconditioned by domain decomposition methods.\n\nRestricted Additive Schwarz (RAS)¶\nThe RAS preconditioner reads:\n\n\\[M^{-1}_{RAS} := \\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T D_j (R_j\\, A\\,R_j^T)^{-1} R_j\\,.\\]\nLet \\(A_{i}\\) denote the local matrix \\((R_i\\, A\\,R_i^T)\\).\nThe application of the operator \\(M^{-1}_{RAS}\\) to a distributed right hand side \\((\\mathbf{RHS}_i)_{i=1}^N\\) consists in computing:\n\n\\[R_i\\, \\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T\\,D_j\\, A_{j}^{-1}\\,\\, \\mathbf{ RHS}_j\n= D_i\\, A_{i}^{-1}\\, \\mathbf{ RHS}_i + \\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal{O}(i)} (R_i\\,R_j^T)\\,D_j\\, A_{j}^{-1}\\, \\mathbf{ RHS}_j\\,.\\]\nThis task is performed by first solving concurrently on all subdomains a linear system for \\({\\mathbf Y}_j\\) for all \\(1\\le j \\le N\\):\n\n\\[A_{j}\\, {\\mathbf Y}_j = \\mathbf{RHS}_j\\,.\\]\nEach local vector \\({\\mathbf Y}_j\\) is weighted by the partition of unity matrix \\(D_j\\).\nThen data transfers between neighboring subdomains implement the \\(R_i\\,R_j^T\\,D_j\\,{\\mathbf Y}_j\\) formula.\nThe contribution from neighboring subdomains are summed locally. This\npattern is very similar to that of the update procedure.\n\n\nOptimized Restricted Additive Schwarz (ORAS)¶\nThe ORAS preconditioner may be seen as a variant of the RAS preconditioner.\nIt reads:\n\n\\[M^{-1}_{RAS} := \\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T D_j\\, B_j^{-1}\\, R_j\\,\\]\nwhere \\(B_j\\) are local matrices of size \\(\\#{\\mathcal N}_j \\times \\#{\\mathcal N}_j\\) for \\(1\\le j \\le N\\).\nThis variant is very useful when dealing with wave propagation phenomena such as Helmholtz problems in acoustics or Maxwell system in the frequency domain for electromagnetism.\nDefining \\(B_j\\) as the discretization of the physical equation with impedance conditions on the boundary of the subdomain\n\n\nTwo level methods¶\nThe RAS method is called a one-level method in the sense that sub-domains only interact with their direct neighbors.\nFor some problems such as Darcy problems or static elasticiy problems and when the number of subdomains is large, such one-level methods may suffer from a slow convergence.\nThe fix is to add to the preconditioner an auxiliary coarse problem that couples all subdomains at each iteration and is inexpensive to calculate.\nWe consider two ways to build this coarse problem, see below Coarse Mesh and GenEO\n\nCoarse Mesh¶\nA first possibility is to discretize the problem on a coarse mesh, following the same principle as multi-grid methods.\nFor 3-D problems, a coarsening of the mesh size by a factor 2, reduces by a factor \\(2^3=8\\) the size of the coarse problem which is then easier to solve by a direct method.\n\n\nGenEO¶\nFor highly heterogeneous or anisotropic problems, two level methods based on coarse meshes might fail and a more sophisticated construction must be used.\nA provable robust coarse space called GenEO is built by first solving the following local generalized eigenvalue problem in parallel for each subdomain \\(1\\le i\\le N\\), where \\(A_i^{\\text{Neu}}\\) denotes the local matrix resulting from the variational formulation:\n\n\\[D_i A_i D_i\\, V_{i,k} = \\lambda_{i,k}\\, A_i^{\\text{Neu}} \\,V_{i,k}\\]\nThe eigenvectors selected to enter the coarse space correspond to eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{i,k} \\ge \\tau\\), where the threshold parameter \\(\\tau\\) is user-defined.\nThe precise formulas are given in this documentation.\nFrom a mathematical point of view, it has been proved that for a symmetric positive definite matrix \\(A\\), the spectrum of the preconditioned by the two-level method with a GenEO coarse space lies in the interval \\([\\displaystyle \\frac{1}{1+k_1\\,\\tau} , k_0 ]\\).\nNote A heuristic that justifies this construction is as follows.\nWe first introduce the Additive Schwarz method (ASM) which can be seen as a symmetrized variant of the RAS preconditioner:\n\n\\[M_{ASM}^{-1} := \\sum_{j=1}^N R_j^T A_j^{-1} R_j\\,.\\]\nIt can be proved that the lower bound for the eigenvalue of \\(M_{ASM}^{-1}\\,A\\) is close to zero (which is bad for convergence) whereas the upper bound depends only on the number of neigbors of a subdomain (which is good for convergence).\nSecond, we also introduce the following preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_{NN}\\):\n\n\\[M^{-1}_{NN} := \\sum_{1\\le j\\le N} D_i\\,(A_j^{\\text{Neu}})^{-1} D_j\\,.\\]\nWe have a very good lower bound for the preconditioned operator \\(M^{-1}_{NN}\\,A\\) that does not depend on the number of subdomains but only on the maximum multiplicity of intersections \\(k_1\\) (which is good for convergence).\nBut the upper bound for this preconditioner is very large (which is bad for convergence).\nNow, if we compare formulas for \\(M^{-1}_{NN}\\) and \\(M^{-1}_{ASM}\\), we may suspect that vectors \\(\\mathbf{V}_{ik}\\) for which \\(D_i\\, (A_i^{\\text{Neu}})^{-1}\\,D_i\\,\\mathbf{V}_{ik}\\) and \\(A_{i}^{-1}\\,\\mathbf{V}_{ik}\\) have very different values are responsible for the slow convergence and should contribute to the coarse space.\nThis is a way to interpret the above generalized eigenvalue problem which controls the lower bound of the two-level preconditioned

\nParameters¶\n\nCommand-line arguments¶\n\n-ffddm_verbosity N, the level of verbosity of ffddm, see ffddmverbosity (default 3).\n-seqddm N use ffddm in sequential mode, with N the number of subdomains.\n\n-noGlob if present, do not define any global quantity (such as saving the global mesh for plotting or building the global restriction matrices).Cannot be used in sequential mode or with plotting.\n\n\n-ffddm_partitioner N specifies how to partition the initial domain, see ffddmpartitioner (default 1, metis).\n-ffddm_overlap N specifies the width of the overlap region between subdomains, see ffddmoverlap (default 1).\n-ffddm_master_p N, number of master processes for the coarse problem (for two level preconditioners), see ffddmpCS (default 1).\n-ffddm_master_exclude 0|1 exclude master processes from the domain decomposition, see ffddmexclude (default 0).\nffddm_split N, level of refinement of the local submeshes with respect to the initial global mesh, see ffddmsplit (default 1).\n-ffddm_schwarz_method S, specifies the type of one level preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_1\\): “asm” (Additive Schwarz), “ras” (Restricted Additive Schwarz), “oras” (Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz), “soras” (Symmetric Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz) or “none” (no preconditioner), see ffddmprecond (default “ras”).\n-ffddm_geneo_nu N, number of local eigenvectors to compute in each subdomain when solving the local generalized eigenvalue problem for the GenEO method, see ffddmnu (default 20).\n\n-ffddm_geneo_threshold R, threshold parameter for selecting local eigenvectors when solving the local generalized eigenvalue problems for the GenEO method, see ffddmtau (default 0.5).If the command-line parameter -ffddm_geneo_nu N is used, then ffddmtau is initialized to 0.\n\n\n-ffddm_schwarz_coarse_correction S, specifies the coarse correction formula to use for the two level preconditioner: “AD” (Additive), “BNN” (Balancing Neumann-Neumann), “ADEF1” (Adapted Deflation Variant 1), “ADEF2” (Adapted Deflation Variant 2), “RBNN1” (Reduced Balancing Variant 1), “RBNN2” (Reduced Balancing Variant 2) or “none” (no coarse correction), see ffddmcorrection (default “ADEF1”).\n\n\n\nGlobal parameters¶\n\nffddmverbosity initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_verbosity N, specifies the level of verbosity of ffddm (default 3).\nffddmpartitioner initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_partitioner N, specifies how to partition the initial domain:\nN=0: user-defined partition through the definition of a macro, see ffddmbuildDmesh\nN=1: use the automatic graph partitioner metis (default)\nN=2: use the automatic graph partitioner scotch\n\n\n\nffddmoverlap initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_overlap N, specifies the number of layers of mesh elements in the overlap region between subdomains N >= 1 (default 1).Remark The actual width of the overlap region between subdomains is 2N, since each subdomain is extended by N layers of elements in a symmetric way.\n\n\n\nffddminterfacelabel the label of the new border of the subdomain meshes (the interface between the subdomains) (default 10).Used for imposing problem-dependent boundary conditions at the interface between subdomains for the preconditioner, for example optimized Robin boundary conditions (see ORAS).\n\n\nffddmpCS initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_master_p N, number of mpi processes used for the assembly and resolution of the coarse problem for two level preconditioners (default 1).\n\nffddmexclude initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_master_exclude, 0 or 1 (default 0).If true, mpi ranks participating in the assembly and resolution of the coarse problem for two level preconditioners will be excluded from the spatial domain decomposition and will only work on the coarse problem.\n\n\n\nffddmsplit initialized by command-line argument ffddm_split N, level of refinement of the local submeshes with respect to the initial global mesh (default 1).This is useful for large problems, where we want to avoid working with a very large global mesh.\nThe idea is to start from a coarser global mesh, and generate finer local meshes in parallel during the mesh decomposition step in order to reach the desired level of refinement for the subdomains.\nFor example, calling ffddmbuildDmesh with ffddmsplit = 3 will generate local submeshes where each mesh element of the initial mesh is split into \\(3^d\\) elements.\n\n\n\nffddmprecond initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_schwarz_method S, specifies the type of one level preconditioner \\(M^{-1}_1\\) to build when calling ffddmsetupPrecond: “asm” (Additive Schwarz), “ras” (Restricted Additive Schwarz), “oras” (Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz), “soras” (Symmetric Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz) or “none” (no preconditioner).Default is “ras”.\nSee ffddmsetupPrecond for more details.\n\n\n\nffddmnu initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_geneo_nu N, number of local eigenvectors to compute in each subdomain when solving the local generalized eigenvalue problem for the GenEO method (default 20).See ffddmgeneosetup for more details.\n\n\n\nffddmtau initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_geneo_threshold R, threshold parameter for selecting local eigenvectors when solving the local generalized eigenvalue problems for the GenEO method (default 0.5).If the command-line parameter -ffddm_geneo_nu N is used, then ffddmtau is initialized to 0.\nSee ffddmgeneosetup for more details.\n\n\n\nffddmcorrection initialized by command-line argument -ffddm_schwarz_coarse_correction S, specifies the coarse correction formula to use for the two level preconditioner: “AD” (Additive), “BNN” (Balancing Neumann-Neumann), “ADEF1” (Adapted Deflation Variant 1), “ADEF2” (Adapted Deflation Variant 2), “RBNN1” (Reduced Balancing Variant 1), “RBNN2” (Reduced Balancing Variant 2) or “none” (no coarse correction).Default is “ADEF1”.\nSee the section about Two level preconditioners for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n

?¶\n\nffddm implements a class of parallel solvers in FreeFem++: overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition methods\n\nThe entire ffddm framework is written in the FreeFem++ language ffddm aims at simplifying the use of parallel solvers in FreeFem++You can find the ffddm scripts and examples here\n\n\n\nffddm provides a set of high-level macros and functions to\nhandle data distribution: distributed meshes and linear algebra\nbuild DD preconditioners for your variational problems\nsolve your problem using preconditioned Krylov methods\n\n\n\n\nffddm implements scalable two level Schwarz methods, with a coarse space correction built either from a coarse mesh or a GenEO coarse space Ongoing research: approximate coarse solves and three level methods\n\nffddm can also act as a wrapper for the HPDDM library.HPDDM is an efficient C++11 implementation of various domain decomposition methods and Krylov subspace algorithms with advanced block and recycling techniques More

The algorithm may start at \\(q^1\\in T_k^0\\) and stall on the boundary (thick line) because the line \\(q^0q^1\\) is not inside \\(\\Omega\\).\nBut if the holes are triangulated too (doted line) then the problem does not arise.\n\nTwo problems need to be solved:\n\nWhat if :math:`q^1` is not in \\(\\Omega^0_h\\) ? Then Step 5 will stop with a boundary triangle.\n\nSo we add a step which tests the distance of \\(q^1\\) with the two adjacent boundary edges and selects the nearest, and so on till the distance grows.\n\n\nWhat if \\(\\Omega^0_h\\) is not convex and the marching process of Step 4 locks on a boundary? By construction Delaunay-Voronoï’s mesh generators always triangulate the convex hull of the vertices of the domain.\n\nTherefore, we make sure that this information is not lost when \\({\\cal T}_{h}^0,{\\cal T}_{h}^1\\) are constructed and we keep the triangles which are outside the domain on a special list.\nThat way, in step 5 we can use that list to step over holes if needed.\n\n\n\n\nNote\nSometimes, in rare cases, the interpolation process misses some points, we can change the search algorithm through a global variable searchMethod\nsearchMethod = 0; // default value for fast search algorithm\nsearchMethod = 1; // safe search algorithm, uses brute force in case of missing point\n// (warning: can be very expensive in cases where a lot of points are outside of the domain)\nsearchMethod = 2; // always uses brute force. It is very computationally expensive.\n\n\n\n\nNote\nStep 3 requires an array of pointers such that each vertex points to one triangle of the triangulation.\n\n\nNote\nThe operator = is the interpolation operator of FreeFem++, the continuous finite functions are extended by continuity to the outside of the domain.\nTry the following example :\n\n// Mesh\nmesh Ths = square(10, 10);\nmesh Thg = square(30, 30, [x*3-1, y*3-1]);\nplot(Ths, Thg, wait=true);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Ch(Ths, P2);\nCh us = (x-0.5)*(y-0.5);\n\nfespace Dh(Ths, P2dc);\nDh vs = (x-0.5)*(y-0.5);\n\nfespace Fh(Thg, P2dc);\nFh ug=us, vg=vs;\n\n// Plot\nplot(us, ug, wait=true);\nplot(vs, vg, wait=true);\n\n\n\n\nFig. 53 Extension of a continuous FE-function\n\n\n\nFig. 54 Extension of discontinuous FE-function\n\n\n\n\n\nKeywords: Problem and Solve¶\nFor FreeFem++, a problem must be given in variational form, so we need a bilinear form \\(a(u,v)\\), a linear form \\(\\ell(f,v)\\), and possibly a boundary condition form must be added.\nproblem P (u, v)\n    = a(u,v) - l(f,v)\n    + (boundary condition)\n    ;\n\n\n\nNote\nWhen you want to formulate the problem and solve it in the same time, you can use the keyword solve.\n\n\nWeak Form and Boundary Condition¶\nTo present the principles of Variational Formulations, also called weak form, for the Partial Differential Equations, let’s take a model problem: a Poisson equation with Dirichlet and Robin Boundary condition.\nThe problem: Find \\(u\\) a real function defined on a domain \\(\\Omega\\) of \\(\\R^d\\) \\((d=2,3)\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcll}\n    -\\nabla\\cdot(\\kappa \\nabla u) &=& f & \\mbox{ in }\\Omega\\\\\n    a u + \\kappa \\frac{\\p u}{\\p n} &=& b & \\mbox{ on }\\Gamma_r\\\\\n    u &=& g & \\mbox{ on }\\Gamma_d\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nwhere:\n\nif \\(d=2\\) then \\(\\nabla.(\\kappa \\nabla u) = \\p_x(\\kappa \\p_x u ) + \\p_y(\\kappa \\p_y u )\\) with \\(\\p_x u = \\frac{\\p u}{\\p x}\\) and \\(\\p_y u = \\frac{\\p u}{\\p y}\\)\nif \\(d=3\\) then \\(\\nabla.(\\kappa \\nabla u) = \\p_x(\\kappa \\p_x u) + \\p_y(\\kappa \\p_y u) + \\p_z(\\kappa \\p_z u)\\) with \\(\\p_x u = \\frac{\\p u}{\\p x}\\), \\(\\p_y u = \\frac{\\p u}{\\p y}\\) and , \\(\\p_z u = \\frac{\\p u}{\\p z}\\)\nThe border \\(\\Gamma=\\p \\Omega\\) is split in \\(\\Gamma_d\\) and \\(\\Gamma_n\\) such that \\(\\Gamma_d \\cap \\Gamma_n = \\emptyset\\) and \\(\\Gamma_d \\cup \\Gamma_n = \\p \\Omega\\),\n\\(\\kappa\\) is a given positive function, such that \\(\\exists \\kappa_0 \\in \\R ,\\quad 0 < \\kappa_0 \\leq \\kappa\\).\n\\(a\\) a given non negative function,\n\\(b\\) a given function.\n\n\nNote\nThis is the well known Neumann boundary condition if \\(a=0\\), and if \\(\\Gamma_d\\) is empty.\nIn this case the function appears in the problem just by its derivatives, so it is defined only up to a constant (if \\(u\\) is a solution then \\(u+c\\) is also a solution).\n\nLet \\({v}\\), a regular test function, null on \\(\\Gamma_d\\), by integration by parts we get:\n\n\\[- \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla\\cdot(\\kappa \\nabla u) \\, {v} \\,d\\omega\n= \\int_{\\Omega} \\kappa \\nabla{ v} \\cdot \\nabla u \\,d\\omega\n- \\int_{\\Gamma} {v}\\kappa \\frac{ \\p u}{\\p \\mathbf{n}} \\,d\\gamma,= \\int_{\\Omega} f {v} \\,d\\omega\\]\nwhere if \\(d=2\\) the \\(\\nabla{ v} . \\nabla u = (\\frac{\\p u}{\\p x}\\frac{\\p { v}}{\\p x}+\\frac{\\p u}{\\p y}\\frac{\\p { v}}{\\p y})\\),\nwhere if \\(d=3\\) the \\(\\nabla{ v} . \\nabla u = (\\frac{\\p u}{\\p x}\\frac{\\p { v}}{\\p x}+\\frac{\\p u}{\\p y}\\frac{\\p { v}}{\\p y} + \\frac{\\p u}{\\p z}\\frac{\\p { v}}{\\p z})\\),\nand where \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is the unitary outer-pointing normal of the \\(\\Gamma\\).\nNow we note that \\(\\kappa \\frac{ \\p u}{\\p n} = - a u + b\\) on \\(\\Gamma_r\\) and \\(v=0\\) on \\(\\Gamma_d\\) and \\(\\Gamma = \\Gamma_d \\cup \\Gamma_n\\) thus:\n\n\\[- \\int_{\\Gamma} {v}\n\\kappa \\frac{ \\p u}{\\p n} = \\int_{\\Gamma_r} a u v - \\int_{\\Gamma_r} b v\\]\nThe problem becomes:\nFind \\(u \\in V_g = \\{w \\in H^1(\\Omega) / w = g \\mbox{ on } \\Gamma_d \\}\\) such that:\n\n(17)¶\\[{\\int_{\\Omega} \\kappa \\nabla{ v} . \\nabla u \\,d\\omega + \\int_{\\Gamma_r} a u v \\,d\\gamma = \\int_{\\Omega} f {v}} \\,d\\omega\n+ \\int_{\\Gamma_r} b v \\,d\\gamma , \\quad \\forall v \\in V_0\\]\nwhere \\(V_0 = \\{v \\in H^1(\\Omega) / v = 0 \\mbox{ on } \\Gamma_d \\}\\)\nExcept in the case of Neumann conditions everywhere, the problem (17) is well posed when \\(\\kappa\\geq \\kappa_0>0\\).\n\nNote\nIf we have only the Neumann boundary condition, linear algebra tells us that the right hand side must be orthogonal to the kernel of the operator for the solution to exist.\n\nOne way of writing the compatibility condition is:\n\n\\[\\int_{\\Omega} f \\,d\\omega + \\int_{\\Gamma} b \\,d\\gamma=0\\]\nand a way to fix the constant is to solve for \\(u \\in H^1(\\Omega)\\) such that:\n\n\\[{\\int_{\\Omega} (\\varepsilon u v \\; + \\; \\kappa \\nabla{ v} . \\nabla u) \\,d\\omega\n= \\int_{\\Omega} f {v}} \\,d\\omega + \\int_{\\Gamma_r} b v \\,d\\gamma , \\quad \\forall v \\in H^1(\\Omega)\\]\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a small parameter (\\(\\sim \\kappa\\; 10^{-10} |\\Omega|^{\\frac2d}\\)).\n\nRemark that if the solution is of order \\(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\) then the compatibility condition is unsatisfied, otherwise we get the solution such that \\(\\int_\\Omega u = 0\\), you can also add a Lagrange multiplier to solve the real mathematical problem like in the Lagrange multipliers example.\n\nIn FreeFem++, the bidimensional problem (17) becomes:\nproblem Pw (u, v)\n    = int2d(Th)( //int_{Omega} kappa nabla v . nabla u\n        kappa*(dx(u)*dx(v) + dy(u)*dy(v))\n    )\n    + int1d(Th, gn)( //int_{Gamma_r} a u v\n        a * u*v\n    )\n    - int2d(Th)( //int_{Omega} f v\n        f*v\n    )\n    - int1d(Th, gn)( //int_{Gamma_r} b v\n        b * v\n    )\n    + on(gd, u=g) //u = g on Gamma_d\n    ;\n\n\nwhere Th is a mesh of the bi-dimensional domain \\(\\Omega\\), and gd and gn are respectively the boundary labels of boundary \\(\\Gamma_d\\) and \\(\\Gamma_n\\).\nAnd the three dimensional problem (17) becomes\nmacro Grad(u) [dx(u), dy(u), dz(u) ]//\nproblem Pw (u, v)\n    = int3d(Th)( //int_{Omega} kappa nabla v . nabla u\n        kappa*(Grad(u)'*Grad(v))\n    )\n    + int2d(Th, gn)( //int_{Gamma_r} a u v\n        a * u*v\n    )\n    - int3d(Th)( //int_{Omega} f v\n        f*v\n    )\n    - int2d(Th, gn)( //int_{Gamma_r} b v\n        b * v\n    )\n    + on(gd, u=g) //u = g on Gamma_d\n    ;\n\n\nwhere Th is a mesh of the three dimensional domain \\(\\Omega\\), and gd and gn are respectively the boundary labels of boundary \\(\\Gamma_d\\) and \\(\\Gamma_n\\).\n\n\n\nParameters affecting solve and problem¶\nThe parameters are FE functions real or complex, the number \\(n\\) of parameters is even (\\(n=2*k\\)), the \\(k\\) first function parameters are unknown, and the \\(k\\) last are test functions.\n\nNote\nIf the functions are a part of vectorial FE then you must give all the functions of the vectorial FE in the same order (see Poisson problem with mixed finite element for example).\n\n\nNote\nDon’t mix complex and real parameters FE function.\n\n\nWarning\nBug:\nThe mixing of multiple fespace with different periodic boundary conditions are not implemented.\nSo all the finite element spaces used for tests or unknown functions in a problem, must have the same type of periodic boundary conditions or no periodic boundary conditions.\nNo clean message is given and the result is unpredictable.\n\nThe parameters are:\n\nsolver= LU, CG, Crout,  Cholesky, GMRES, sparsesolver, UMFPACK …\n\nThe default solver is sparsesolver (it is equal to UMFPACK if no other sparse solver is defined) or is set to LU if no direct sparse solver is available.\nThe storage mode of the matrix of the underlying linear system depends on the type of solver chosen; for LU the matrix is sky-line non symmetric, for Crout the matrix is sky-line symmetric, for Cholesky the matrix is sky-line symmetric positive definite, for CG the matrix is sparse symmetric positive, and for GMRES, sparsesolver or UMFPACK the matrix is just sparse.\n\n\neps= a real expression.\n\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) sets the stopping test for the iterative methods like CG.\nNote that if \\(\\varepsilon\\) is negative then the stopping test is:\n\n\\[|| A x - b || < |\\varepsilon|\\]\nif it is positive, then the stopping test is:\n\n\\[|| A x - b || < \\frac{|\\varepsilon|}{|| A x_{0} - b ||}\\]\n\n\ninit= boolean expression, if it is false or 0 the matrix is reconstructed.\n\nNote that if the mesh changes the matrix is reconstructed too.\n\n\nprecon= name of a function (for example P) to set the preconditioner.\n\nThe prototype for the function P must be:\nfunc real[int] P(real[int] & xx);\n\n\n\n\ntgv= Huge value (\\(10^{30}\\)) used to implement Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n\ntolpivot= sets the tolerance of the pivot in UMFPACK (\\(10^{-1}\\)) and, LU, Crout, Cholesky factorisation (\\(10^{-20}\\)).\n\ntolpivotsym= sets the tolerance of the pivot sym in UMFPACK\n\nstrategy= sets the integer UMFPACK strategy (\\(0\\) by default).\n\n\n\n\nProblem definition¶\nBelow v is the unknown function and w is the test function.\nAfter the “=” sign, one may find sums of:\n\nIdentifier(s); this is the name given earlier to the variational form(s) (type varf ) for possible reuse.\n\nRemark, that the name in the varf of the unknown test function is forgotten, we use the order in the argument list to recall names as in a C++ function,\n\n\nThe terms of the bilinear form itself: if \\(K\\) is a given function,\n\nBilinear part for 3D meshes Th\n\n\nint3d(Th)(K*v*w) = \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{T\\in\\mathtt{Th}}\\int_{T }

Form, Sparse Matrix, PDE Data Vector¶\nIn FreeFem++ it is possible to define variational forms, and use them to build matrices and vectors, and store them to speed-up the script (4 times faster here).\nFor example let us solve the Thermal Conduction problem.\nThe variational formulation is in \\(L^2(0,T;H^1(\\Omega))\\); we shall seek \\(u^n\\) satisfying:\n\n\\[\\forall w \\in V_{0}; \\qquad \\int_\\Omega \\frac{u^n-u^{n-1}}{\\delta t} w + \\kappa\\n u^n\\n w) +\\int_\\Gamma\\alpha(u^n-u_{ue})w=0\\]\nwhere \\(V_0 = \\{w\\in H^1(\\Omega)/ w_{|\\Gamma_{24}}=0\\}\\).\nSo to code the method with the matrices \\(A=(A_{ij})\\), \\(M=(M_{ij})\\), and the vectors \\(u^n, b^n, b',b\", b_{cl}\\) (notation if \\(w\\) is a vector then \\(w_i\\) is a component of the

vthermic(Vh, Vh, tgv=tgv, solver=CG);\nmatrix M = vMass(Vh, Vh);\n\n\nNow, to build the right hand size we need 4 vectors.\nreal[int] b0 = vthermic0(0, Vh); //constant part of the RHS\nreal[int] bcn = vthermic(0, Vh); //tgv on Dirichlet boundary node ( !=0 )\n//we have for the node i : i in Gamma_24 -> bcn[i] != 0\nreal[int] bcl = tgv*u0[]; //the Dirichlet boundary condition part\n\n\n\nNote\nThe boundary condition is implemented by penalization and vector bcn contains the contribution of the boundary condition \\(u=1\\), so to change the boundary condition, we have just to multiply the vector bc[] by the current value f of the new boundary condition term by term with the operator .*.\nUzawa model gives a real example of using all this features.\n\nAnd the new version of the algorithm is now:\n// Time loop\nofstream ff(\"thermic.dat\");\nfor(real t = 0; t < T; t += dt){\n    // Update\n    real[int] b = b0; //for the RHS\n    b += M*u[]; //add the the time dependent part\n    //lock boundary part:\n    b = bcn ? bcl : b; //do forall i: b[i] = bcn[i] ? bcl[i] : b[i]\n\n    // Solve\n    u[] = A^-1*b;\n\n    // Save\n    ff << t << \" \" << u(3, 0.5) << endl;\n\n    // Plot\n    plot(u);\n}\n\n// Display\nfor(int i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n    cout << dy(u)(6.0*i/20.0, 0.9) << endl;\n\n// Plot\nplot(u, fill=true, wait=true);\n\n\n\nNote\nThe functions appearing in the variational form are formal and local to the varf definition, the only important thing is the order in the parameter list, like in:\nvarf vb1([u1, u2], q) = int2d(Th)((dy(u1) + dy(u2))*q) + int2d(Th)(1*q);\nvarf vb2([v1, v2], p) = int2d(Th)((dy(v1) + dy(v2))*p) + int2d(Th)(1*p);\n\n\n\nTo build matrix \\(A\\) from the bilinear part the variational form \\(a\\) of type varf simply write:\nA = a(Vh, Wh , []...]);\n// where\n//Vh is \"fespace\" for the unknown fields with a correct number of component\n//Wh is \"fespace\" for the test fields with a correct number of component\n\n\nPossible named parameters in , [...] are\n\nsolver= LU, CG, Crout, Cholesky, GMRES, sparsesolver, UMFPACK …\n\nThe default solver is GMRES.\nThe storage mode of the matrix of the underlying linear system depends on the type of solver chosen; for LU the matrix is sky-line non symmetric, for Crout the matrix is sky-line symmetric, for Cholesky the matrix is sky-line symmetric positive definite, for CG the matrix is sparse symmetric positive, and for GMRES, sparsesolver or UMFPACK the matrix is just sparse.\n\n\nfactorize = If true then do the matrix factorization for LU, Cholesky or Crout, the default value is false.\n\neps= A real expression.\n\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) sets the stopping test for the iterative methods like CG.\nNote that if \\(\\varepsilon\\) is negative then the stopping test is:\n\n\\[|| A x - b || < |\\varepsilon|\\]\nif it is positive then the stopping test is\n\n\\[|| A x - b || < \\frac{|\\varepsilon|}{|| A x_{0} - b ||}\\]\n\n\nprecon= Name of a function (for example P) to set the preconditioner.\nThe prototype for the function P must be:\nfunc real[int] P(real[int] & xx) ;\n\n\n\ntgv= Huge value (\\(10^{30}\\)) used to implement Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n\ntolpivot= Set the tolerance of the pivot in UMFPACK (\\(10^-1\\)) and, LU, Crout, Cholesky factorization (\\(10^{-20}\\)).\n\ntolpivotsym= Set the tolerance of the pivot sym in UMFPACK\n\nstrategy= Set the integer UMFPACK strategy (\\(0\\) by default).\n\n\n\nNote\nThe line of the matrix corresponding to the space Wh and the column of the matrix corresponding to the space Vh.\n\nTo build the dual vector b (of type real[int]) from the linear part of the variational form a do simply:\nreal b(Vh.ndof);\nb = a(0, Vh);\n\n\nA first example to compute the area of each triangle \\(K\\) of mesh \\(Th\\), just do:\nfespace Nh(Th, P0); //the space function constant / triangle\nNh areaK;\nvarf varea (unused, chiK) = int2d(Th)(chiK);\netaK[] = varea(0, Ph);\n\n\nEffectively, the basic functions of space \\(Nh\\), are the characteristic function of the element of Th, and the numbering is the numeration of the element, so by construction:\n\n\\[\\mathtt{etaK}[i] = \\int {1}_{|K_i} = \\int_{K_i} 1;\\]\nNow, we can use this to compute error indicators like in example Adaptation using residual error indicator.\nFirst to compute a continuous approximation to the function \\(h\\) “density mesh

qfnbpE=1)(v/lenEdge);\n\n// Computation of the mesh size\ncount = vedgecount(0, Vh); //number of edge / vertex\nh[] = vmeshsizen(0, Vh); //sum length edge / vertex\nh[] = h[]./count; //mean length edge / vertex\n\n\nTo compute error indicator for Poisson equation:\n\n\\[{\\eta_K = \\int_K h_K^2 |( f + \\Delta u_h)|^2 + \\int_{\\partial K} h_e |[ \\frac{\\partial u_h}{\\partial n} ]|^2 }\\]\nwhere \\(h_K\\) is size of the longest edge (hTriangle), \\(h_e\\) is the size of the current edge (lenEdge), \\(n\\) the normal.\nfespace Nh(Th, P0); // the space function constant / triangle\nNh etak;\nvarf vetaK (unused, chiK)\n    = intalledges(Th)(\n        chiK*lenEdge*square(jump(N.x*dx(u) + N.y*dy(u)))\n    )\n    + int2d(Th)(\n        chiK*square(hTriangle*(f + dxx(u) + dyy(u)))\n    )\n    ;\n\netak[] = vetaK(0, Ph);\n\n\nWe add automatic expression optimization by default, if this optimization creates problems, it can be removed with the keyword optimize as in the following example:\nvarf a (u1, u2)\n    = int2d(Th, optimize=0)(\n        dx(u1)*dx(u2)\n        + dy(u1)*dy(u2)\n    )\n    + on(1, 2, 4, u1=0)\n    + on(3, u1=1)\n    ;\n\n\nor you can also do optimization and remove the check by setting optimize=2.\nRemark, it is all possible to build interpolation matrix, like in the following example:\nmesh TH = square(3, 4);\nmesh th = square(2, 3);\nmesh Th = square(4, 4);\n\nfespace VH(TH, P1);\nfespace Vh(th, P1);\nfespace Wh(Th, P1);\n\nmatrix B = interpolate(VH, Vh); //build interpolation matrix Vh->VH\nmatrix BB = interpolate(Wh, Vh); //build interpolation matrix Vh->Wh\n\n\nand after some operations on sparse matrices are available for example:\nint N = 10;\nreal [int, int] A(N, N); //a full matrix\nreal [int] a(N), b(N);\nA = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < N; i++){\n    A(i, i) = 1+i;\n    if (i+1 < N) A(i, i+1) = -i;\n    a[i] = i;\n}\nb = A*b;\nmatrix sparseA = A;\ncout << sparseA << endl;\nsparseA = 2*sparseA + sparseA';\nsparseA = 4*sparseA + sparseA*5;\nmatrix sparseB = sparseA + sparseA + sparseA; ;\ncout << \"sparseB = \" << sparseB(0,0) << endl;\n\n\n\n\nInterpolation matrix¶\nIt is also possible to store the matrix of a linear interpolation operator from a finite element space \\(V_h\\) to another \\(W_h\\) to interpolate(\\(W_h\\),\\(V_h\\),…) a function.\nNote that the continuous finite functions are extended by continuity outside of the domain.\nThe named parameters of function interpolate are:\n\ninside= set true to create zero-extension.\n\nt= set true to get the transposed matrix\n\nop= set an integer written below\n\n\n0 the default value and interpolate of the function\n1 interpolate the \\(\\p_x\\)\n2 interpolate the \\(\\p_y\\)\n3 interpolate the \\(\\p_z\\)\n\n\n\nU2Vc= set the which is the component of \\(W_h\\) come in \\(V_h\\) in interpolate process in a int array so the size of the array is number of component of \\(W_h\\), if the put \\(-1\\) then component is set to \\(0\\), like in the following example: (by default the component number is unchanged).\n\nfespace V4h(Th4, [P1, P1, P1, P1]);\nfespace V3h(Th, [P1, P1, P1]);\nint[int] u2vc = [1, 3, -1]; //-1 -> put zero on the component\nmatrix IV34 = interpolate(V3h, V4h, inside=0, U2Vc=u2vc); //V3h <- V4h\nV4h [a1, a2, a3, a4] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nV3h [b1, b2, b3] = [10, 20, 30];\nb1[] = IV34*a1[];\n\n\nSo here we have: freefem   b1 == 2, b2 == 4, b3 == 0 ...\n\n\n\n\nTip\nMatrix interpolation\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(4, 4);\nmesh Th4 = square(2, 2, [x*0.5,

endl;\n\nmatrix IVt0 = interpolate(Vh, Vh4, inside=1, t=1);\ncout << \"IV Vh<-Vh4^t (inside=1) \" << IVt0 << endl;\n\nmatrix IV4t0 = interpolate(Vh4, Vh);\ncout << \"IV Vh4<-Vh^t \" << IV4t0 << endl;\n\nmatrix IW4 = interpolate(Wh4, Wh);\ncout << \"IV Wh4<-Wh \" << IW4 << endl;\n\nmatrix IW4V = interpolate(Wh4, Vh);\ncout << \"IV Wh4<-Vh \" << IW4 << endl;\n\n\nBuild interpolation matrix \\(A\\) at a array of points \\((xx[j],yy[j]),\\ i = 0,\\ 2\\) here:\n\n\\[a_ij = dop(w^i_c (xx[j],yy[j]))\\]\nwhere \\(w_i\\) is the basic finite element function, \\(c\\) the component number, \\(dop\\) the type of diff operator like in op def.\nreal[int] xx = [.3, .4], yy = [.1, .4];\nint c = 0, dop = 0;\nmatrix Ixx = interpolate(Vh, xx, yy, op=dop, composante=c);\ncout << Ixx << endl;\nVh ww;\nreal[int] dd = [1, 2];\nww[] = Ixx*dd;\n\n\n\n\nTip\nSchwarz\nThe following shows how to implement with an interpolation matrix a domain decomposition algorithm based on Schwarz method with Robin conditions.\nGiven a non-overlapping partition \\(\\bar\\Omega=\\bar\\Omega_0\\cup\\bar\\Omega_1\\) with \\(\\Omega_0\\cap\\Omega_1=\\emptyset\\), \\(\\Sigma:=\\bar\\Omega_0\\cap\\bar\\Omega_1\\) the algorithm is:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}-\\Delta u_i &= f \\hbox{ in }\\Omega_i,~i=0,1,\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial(u_1-u_0)}{\\partial n} + \\alpha (u_1-u_0) &=0\\hbox{ on }\\Sigma.\\end{split}\\]\nThe same in variational form is:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    &\\int_{\\Omega_i}\\nabla u_i\\cdot\\nabla v &+ \\int_\\Sigma\\alpha u_i v = \\int_{\\Omega_i}f v\\\\\n    - \\int_{\\Omega_j}(\\nabla

finite element space \\(V_h\\) simply replace \\(H^1_0(\\Omega)\\) by \\(V_h(\\Omega_0)\\cup V_h(\\Omega_1)\\).\nThen difficulty is to compute \\(\\int_{\\Omega_j} \\nabla u_j\\cdot\\nabla v\\) when

keywords: border and buildmesh.\n\nSquare¶\nThe command square triangulates the unit square.\nThe following generates a \\(4 \\times 5\\) grid in the unit square \\([0,1]^2\\). The labels of the boundaries are shown in Fig. 1.\nmesh Th = square(4, 5);\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Boundary labels of the mesh by square(10,10)\n\nTo construct a \\(n\\times m\\) grid in the rectangle \\([x_0,x_1]\\times [y_0,y_1]\\), proceed as follows:\nreal x0 = 1.2;\nreal x1 = 1.8;\nreal y0 = 0;\nreal y1 = 1;\nint n = 5;\nreal m = 20;\nmesh Th = square(n, m, [x0+(x1-x0)*x, y0+(y1-y0)*y]);\n\n\n\nNote\nAdding the named parameter flags=icase with icase:\n\nwill produce a mesh where all quads are split with diagonal \\(x-y=constant\\)\nwill produce Union Jack flag type of mesh\nwill produce a mesh where all quads are split with diagonal \\(x+y=constant\\)\nsame as in case 0, except two corners where the triangles are the same as case 2 to avoid having 3 vertices on the boundary\nsame as in case 2, except two corners where the triangles are the same as case 0 to avoid having 3 vertices on the boundary\n\nmesh Th = square(n, m, [x0+(x1-x0)*x, y0+(y1-y0)*y], flags=icase);\n\n\n\n\nNote\nAdding the named parameter label=labs will\nchange the 4 default label numbers to labs[i-1], for\nexample int[int] labs=[11, 12, 13, 14], and adding the\nnamed parameter region=10 will change the region number\nto \\(10\\), for instance (v 3.8).\nTo see all of these flags at work, check Square mesh example:\nfor (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i){\n  int[int] labs = [11, 12, 13, 14];\n  mesh Th = square(3, 3, flags=i, label=labs, region=10);\n  plot(Th, wait=1, cmm=\"square flags = \"+i );\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nBorder¶\nBoundaries are defined piecewise by parametrized curves. The pieces can only intersect at their endpoints, but it is possible to join more than two endpoints. This can be used to structure the mesh if an area touches a border and create new regions by dividing larger ones:\nint upper = 1;\nint others = 2;\nint inner = 3;\n\nborder C01(t=0, 1){x=0; y=-1+t; label=upper;}\nborder C02(t=0, 1){x=1.5-1.5*t; y=-1; label=upper;}\nborder C03(t=0, 1){x=1.5; y=-t; label=upper;}\nborder C04(t=0, 1){x=1+0.5*t; y=0; label=others;}\nborder C05(t=0, 1){x=0.5+0.5*t; y=0; label=others;}\nborder C06(t=0, 1){x=0.5*t; y=0; label=others;}\nborder C11(t=0, 1){x=0.5; y=-0.5*t; label=inner;}\nborder C12(t=0, 1){x=0.5+0.5*t; y=-0.5; label=inner;}\nborder C13(t=0, 1){x=1; y=-0.5+0.5*t; label=inner;}\n\nint n = 10;\nplot(C01(-n) + C02(-n) + C03(-n) + C04(-n) + C05(-n)\n  + C06(-n) + C11(n) + C12(n) + C13(n), wait=true);\n\nmesh Th = buildmesh(C01(-n) + C02(-n) + C03(-n) + C04(-n) + C05(-n)\n  + C06(-n) + C11(n) + C12(n) + C13(n));\n\nplot(Th, wait=true);\n\ncout << \"Part 1 has region number \" << Th(0.75, -0.25).region << endl;\ncout << \"Part 2 has redion number \" << Th(0.25, -0.25).region << endl;\n\n\nBorders and mesh are respectively shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.\n\n\nFig. 2 Multiple border ends intersect\n\n\n\nFig. 3 Generated mesh\n\nTriangulation keywords assume that the domain is defined as being on the left (resp right) of its oriented parameterized boundary\n\n\\[\\Gamma_j = \\{(x,y)\\left|\\; x=\\varphi_x(t),\\, y=\\varphi_y(t),\\, a_j\\le t\\le b_j\\right.\\}\\]\nTo check the orientation plot \\(t\\mapsto (\\varphi_x(t),\\varphi_y(t)),\\, t_0\\le t\\le t_1\\). If it is as in Fig. 4, then the domain lies on the shaded area, otherwise it lies on the opposite side.\n\n\nFig. 4 Orientation of the boundary defined by \\((\\phi_x(t),\\phi_y(t))\\)\n\nThe general expression to define a triangulation with buildmesh is\nmesh Mesh_Name = buildmesh(Gamma1(m1)+...+GammaJ(mj), OptionalParameter);\n\n\nwhere \\(m_j\\) are positive or negative numbers to indicate how many vertices should be on \\(\\Gamma_j,\\, \\Gamma=\\cup_{j=1}^J \\Gamma_J\\), and the optional parameter (see also References), separated with a comma, can be:\n\nnbvx= int, to set the maximum number of vertices in the mesh.\nfixedborder= bool, to say if the mesh generator can change the boundary mesh or not (by default the boundary mesh can change; beware that with periodic boundary conditions (see. Finite Element), it can be dangerous.\n\nThe orientation of boundaries can be changed by changing the sign of \\(m_j\\).\nThe following example shows how to change the orientation. The example generates the unit disk with a small circular hole, and assigns “1” to the unit disk (“2” to the circle inside). The boundary label must be non-zero, but it can also be omitted.\nborder a(t=0, 2*pi){x=cos(t); y=sin(t); label=1;}\nborder b(t=0, 2*pi){x=0.3+0.3*cos(t); y=0.3*sin(t); label=2;}\nplot(a(50) + b(30)); //to see a plot of the border mesh\nmesh Thwithouthole = buildmesh(a(50) + b(30));\nmesh Thwithhole = buildmesh(a(50) + b(-30));\nplot(Thwithouthole, ps=\"Thwithouthole.eps\");\nplot(Thwithhole, ps=\"Thwithhole.eps\");\n\n\n\nNote\nNotice that the orientation is changed by b(-30) in the 5th line. In the 7th line, ps=\"fileName\" is used to generate a postscript file with identification shown on the figure.\n\n\n\nFig. 5 Mesh without hole\n\n\n\nFig. 6 Mesh with hole\n\n\nNote\nBorders are evaluated only at the time plot or buildmesh is called so the global variables are defined at this time. In this case, since \\(r\\) is changed between the two border calls, the following code will not work because the first border will be computed with r=0.3:\nreal r=1;\nborder a(t=0, 2*pi){x=r*cos(t); y=r*sin(t); label=1;}\nr=0.3;\nborder b(t=0, 2*pi){x=r*cos(t); y=r*sin(t); label=1;}\nmesh Thwithhole = buildmesh(a(50) + b(-30)); // bug (a trap) because\n    // the two circles have the same radius = :math:`0.3`\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Border¶\nSometimes it can be useful to make an array of the border, but unfortunately it is incompatible with the FreeFem++ syntax. To bypass this problem, if the number of segments of the discretization \\(n\\) is an array, we make an implicit loop on all of the values of the array, and the index variable \\(i\\) of the loop is defined after the parameter definition, like in border a(t=0, 2*pi; i) …\nA first very small example:\nborder a(t=0, 2*pi; i){x=(i+1)*cos(t); y=(i+1)*sin(t); label=1;}\nint[int] nn = [10, 20, 30];\nplot(a(nn)); //plot 3 circles with 10, 20, 30 points\n\n\nAnd a more complex example to define a square with small circles:\nreal[int] xx = [0, 1, 1, 0],\n          yy = [0, 0, 1, 1];\n//radius, center of the 4 circles\nreal[int] RC = [0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.1],\n          XC = [0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8],\n          YC = [0.2, 0.8, 0.8, 0.2];\nint[int] NC = [-10,-11,-12,13]; //list number of :math:`\\pm` segments of the 4 circles borders\n\nborder bb(t=0, 1; i)\n{\n    // i is the index variable of the multi border loop\n    int ii = (i+1)%4;\n    real t1 = 1-t;\n    x = xx[i]*t1 + xx[ii]*t;\n    y = yy[i]*t1 + yy[ii]*t;\n    label = 0;\n}\n\nborder cc(t=0, 2*pi; i)\n{\n    x = RC[i]*cos(t) + XC[i];\n    y = RC[i]*sin(t) + YC[i];\n    label = i + 1;\n}\nint[int] nn = [4, 4, 5, 7]; //4 border, with 4, 4, 5, 7 segment respectively\nplot(bb(nn), cc(NC), wait=1);\nmesh th = buildmesh(bb(nn) + cc(NC));\nplot(th, wait=1);\n\n\n\n\nData Structures and Read/Write Statements for a Mesh¶\nUsers who want to read a triangulation made elsewhere should see the structure of the file generated below:\nborder C(t=0, 2*pi){x=cos(t); y=sin(t);}\nmesh Th = buildmesh(C(10));\nsavemesh(Th, \"mesh.msh\");\n\n\nThe mesh is shown on Fig. 7.\nThe information about Th are saved in the file mesh.msh whose structure is shown on Table 1.\nThere, \\(n_v\\) denotes the number of vertices, \\(n_t\\) the number of triangles and \\(n_s\\) the number of edges on boundary.\nFor each vertex \\(q^i,\\, i=1,\\cdots,n_v\\), denoted by \\((q^i_x,q^i_y)\\) the \\(x\\)-coordinate and \\(y\\)-coordinate.\nEach triangle \\(T_k, k=1,\\cdots,n_t\\) has three vertices \\(q^{k_1},\\, q^{k_2},\\,q^{k_3}\\) that are oriented counter-clockwise.\nThe boundary consists of 10 lines \\(L_i,\\, i=1,\\cdots,10\\) whose end points are \\(q^{i_1},\\, q^{i_2}\\).\n\n\nFig. 7 Mesh by :freefem`buildmesh(C(10))`\n\nIn the Fig. 7, we have the following.\n\\(n_v=14, n_t=16, n_s=10\\)\n\\(q^1=(-0.309016994375, 0.951056516295)\\)\n\\(\\dots\\)\n\\(q^{14}=(-0.309016994375, -0.951056516295)\\)\nThe vertices of \\(T_1\\) are \\(q^9, q^{12},\\, q^{10}\\).\n\\(\\dots\\)\nThe vertices of \\(T_{16}\\) are \\(q^9, q^{10}, q^{6}\\).\nThe edge of the 1st side \\(L_1\\) are \\(q^6, q^5\\).\n\\(\\dots\\)\nThe edge of the 10th side \\(L_{10}\\) are \\(q^{10}, q^6\\).\n\nTable 1 The structure of mesh_sample.msh¶\n\n\n\n\n\nContent of the file\nExplanation\n\n\n\n14 16 10\n\\(n_v\\quad n_t\\quad n_e\\)\n\n-0.309016994375 0.951056516295 1\n0.309016994375 0.951056516295 1\n…\n-0.309016994375 -0.951056516295 1\n\n\\(q^1_x\\quad q^1_y\\quad\\) boundary label \\(=1\\)\n\\(q^2_x\\quad q^2_y\\quad\\) boundary label \\(=1\\)\n…\n\\(q^{14}_x\\quad q^{14}_y\\quad\\) boundary label \\(=1\\)\n\n\n9 12 10 0\n5 9 6 0\n…\n9 10 6 0\n\n\\(1_1\\quad 1_2\\quad 1_3\\quad\\) region label \\(=0\\)\n\\(2_1\\quad 2_2\\quad 2_3\\quad\\) region label \\(=0\\)\n…\n\\(16_1\\quad 16_2\\quad 16_3\\quad\\) region label \\(=0\\)\n\n\n6 5 1\n5 2 1\n…\n10 6 1\n\n\\(1_1\\quad 1_2\\quad\\) boundary label \\(=1\\)\n\\(2_1\\quad 2_2\\quad\\) boundary label \\(=1\\)\n…\n\\(10_1\\quad 10_2\\quad\\) boundary label \\(=1\\)\n\n\n\n\nIn FreeFem++ there are many mesh file formats available for communication with other tools such as emc2, modulef, … (see Mesh format chapter ).\nThe extension of a file implies its format.\nMore details can be found on the file format .msh in the article by F. Hecht “bamg : a bidimensional anisotropic mesh generator” [HECHT1998_2].\nA mesh file can be read into FreeFem++ except that the names of the borders are lost and only their reference numbers are kept.\nSo these borders have to be referenced by the number which corresponds to their order of appearance in the program, unless this number is overwritten by the keyword label. Here are some examples:\nborder floor(t=0, 1){x=t; y=0; label=1;}\nborder right(t=0, 1){x=1; y=t; label=5;}\nborder ceiling(t=1, 0){x=t; y=1; label=5;}\nborder left(t=1, 0){x=0; y=t; label=5;}\n\nint

useful to build a mesh from a table function.\nThe coordinates of the points and the value of the table function are defined separately with rows of the form: x y f(x,y) in a file such as:\n0.51387 0.175741 0.636237\n0.308652 0.534534 0.746765\n0.947628 0.171736 0.899823\n0.702231 0.226431 0.800819\n0.494773 0.12472 0.580623\n0.0838988 0.389647 0.456045\n...............\n\n\n\n\nFig. 8 Delaunay mesh of the convex hull of point set in file xy\n\n\n\nFig. 9 Isolvalue of table function\n\nThe third column of each line is left untouched by the triangulate command.\nBut you can use this third value to define a table function with rows of the form: x y f(x,y).\nThe following example shows how to make a mesh from the file xyf with the format stated just above.\nThe command triangulate only uses the 1st and 2nd columns.\n// Build the Delaunay mesh of the convex hull\nmesh Thxy=triangulate(\"xyf\"); //points are defined by the first 2 columns of file `xyf`\n\n// Plot the created

yy[]);\n\n\n\nBoundary FEM Spaces Built as Empty Meshes¶\nTo define a Finite Element space on a boundary, we came up with the idea of a mesh with no internal points (called empty mesh).\nIt can be useful to handle Lagrange multipliers in mixed and mortar methods.\nSo the function emptymesh removes all the internal points of a mesh except points on internal boundaries.\n{\n    border a(t=0, 2*pi){x=cos(t); y=sin(t); label=1;}\n    mesh Th = buildmesh(a(20));\n    Th = emptymesh(Th);\n    plot(Th);\n}\n\n\nIt is also possible to build an empty mesh of a pseudo subregion with emptymesh(Th, ssd) using the set of edges from the mesh Th; an edge \\(e\\) is in this set when, with the two adjacent triangles \\(e =t1\\cap t2\\) and \\(ssd[T1] \\neq ssd[T2]\\) where \\(ssd\\) refers to the pseudo region numbering of triangles, they are stored in the int[int] array of size “the number of triangles”.\n{\n    mesh Th = square(10, 10);\n    int[int] ssd(Th.nt);\n    //build the pseudo region numbering\n    for(int i = 0; i < ssd.n; i++){\n        int iq = i/2; //because 2 triangles per quad\n        int ix = iq%10;\n        int iy = iq/10;\n        ssd[i] = 1 + (ix>=5) + (iy>=5)*2;\n    }\n    //build emtpy with all edges $e=T1 \\cap T2$ and $ssd[T1] \\neq ssd[T2]$\n    Th = emptymesh(Th, ssd);\n    //plot\n    plot(Th);\n    savemesh(Th, \"emptymesh.msh\");\n}\n\n\n\n\nFig. 10 The empty mesh with boundary\n\n\n\nFig. 11 An empty mesh defined from a pseudo region numbering of triangle\n\n\n\nRemeshing¶\n\n\n\nMovemesh¶\nMeshes can be translated, rotated, and deformed by movemesh; this is useful for elasticity to watch the deformation due to the displacement \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}(x,y)=(\\Phi_1(x,y),\\Phi_2(x,y))\\) of shape.\nIt is also useful to handle free boundary problems or optimal shape problems.\nIf \\(\\Omega\\) is triangulated as \\(T_h(\\Omega)\\), and \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}\\) is a displacement vector then \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi}(T_h)\\) is obtained by:\nmesh Th = movemesh(Th,[Phi1, Phi2]);\n\n\nSometimes the transformed mesh is invalid because some triangles have flipped over (meaning it now has a negative area).\nTo spot such problems, one may check the minimum triangle area in the transformed mesh with checkmovemesh before any real transformation.\nFor example:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\Phi_1(x,y) &=& x+k*\\sin(y*\\pi)/10)\\\\\n    \\Phi_2(x,y) &=& y+k*\\cos(y\\pi)/10)\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nfor a big number \\(k>1\\).\nverbosity = 4;\n\n// Parameters\nreal coef = 1;\n\n// Mesh\nborder a(t=0, 1){x=t; y=0; label=1;};\nborder b(t=0, 0.5){x=1; y=t; label=1;};\nborder c(t=0, 0.5){x=1-t; y=0.5;

defined on a mesh Th.\nA statement like Th=movemesh(Th...) does not change \\(u\\) and so the old mesh still exists.\nIt will be destroyed when no function uses it.\nA statement like \\(u=u\\) redefines \\(u\\) on the new mesh Th with interpolation and therefore destroys the old Th, if \\(u\\) was the only function using it.\n\nNow, we give an example of moving a mesh with a Lagrangian function \\(u\\) defined on the moving mesh.\n// Parameters\nint nn = 10;\nreal dt = 0.1;\n\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(nn, nn);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=y;\n\n// Loop\nreal t=0;\nfor

Min area = \" << minarea << endl;\n\n    real[int] tmp(u[].n);\n    tmp = u[]; //save the value\n    u = 0;//to change the FEspace and mesh associated with u\n    u[] = tmp;//set the value of u without any mesh update\n    plot(Th, u, wait=true);\n}\n// In this program, since u is only defined on the last mesh, all the\n// previous meshes are deleted from memory.\n\n\n\nRegular Triangulation: hTriangle¶\nFor a set \\(S\\), we define the diameter of \\(S\\) by\n\n\\[\\textrm{diam}(S)=\\sup\\{|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|; \\; \\mathbf{x},\\, \\mathbf{y}\\in S\\}\\]\nThe sequence \\(\\{\\mathcal{T}_h\\}_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\) of\n\\(\\Omega\\) is called regular if they satisfy the following:\n\n\\(\\lim_{h\\rightarrow 0}\\max\\{\\textrm{diam}(T_k)|\\; T_k\\in \\mathcal{T}_h\\}=0\\)\nThere is a number \\(\\sigma>0\\) independent of \\(h\\) such that \\(\\frac{\\rho(T_k)}{\\textrm{diam}(T_k)}\\ge \\sigma\\quad \\textrm{for all }T_k\\in \\mathcal{T}_h\\) where \\(\\rho(T_k)\\) are the diameter of the inscribed circle of \\(T_k\\).\n\nWe put \\(h(\\mathcal{T}_h)=\\max\\{\\textrm{diam}(T_k)|\\; T_k\\in \\mathcal{T}_h\\}\\), which is obtained by\nmesh Th = ......;\nfespace Ph(Th, P0);\nPh h = hTriangle;\ncout << \"size of mesh = \" << h[].max << endl;\n\n\n\n\nAdaptmesh¶\nThe function:\n\n\\[f(x,y) = 10.0x^3+y^3+\\tan^{-1}[\\varepsilon/(\\sin(5.0y)-2.0x)],\\ \\varepsilon = 0.0001\\]\nsharply varies in value and the initial mesh given by one of the commands in the Mesh Generation part cannot reflect its sharp variations.\n// Parameters\nreal eps = 0.0001;\nreal h = 1;\nreal hmin = 0.05;\nfunc f = 10.0*x^3 + y^3 + h*atan2(eps, sin(5.0*y)-2.0*x);\n\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(5, 5, [-1+2*x, -1+2*y]);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh(Th,P1);\nVh fh = f;\nplot(fh);\n\n// Adaptmesh\nfor (int i = 0; i < 2; i++){\n    Th = adaptmesh(Th, fh);\n    fh = f; //old mesh is deleted\n    plot(Th, fh, wait=true);\n}\n\n\n\n\nFig. 14 3D graphs for the initial mesh and 1st and 2nd mesh adaptations\n\nFreeFem++ uses a variable metric/Delaunay automatic meshing algorithm.\nThe command:\nmesh ATh = adaptmesh(Th, f);\n\n\ncreate the new mesh ATh adapted to the Hessian\n\n\\[D^2f=(\\partial^2 f/\\partial x^2,\\, \\partial^2 f/\\partial x\\partial y, \\partial^2 f/\\partial y^2)\\]\nof a function (formula or FE-function).\nMesh adaptation is a very powerful tool when the solution of a problem varies locally and sharply.\nHere we solve the Poisson’s problem, when \\(f=1\\) and \\(\\Omega\\) is a L-shape domain.\n\n\nFig. 15 L-shape domain and its boundary name\n\n\n\nFig. 16 Final solution after 4-times adaptation\n\n\nTip\nThe solution has the singularity \\(r^{3/2},\\, r=|x-\\gamma|\\) at the point \\(\\gamma\\) of the intersection of two lines \\(bc\\) and \\(bd\\) (see Fig. 15).\n\n// Parameters\nreal error = 0.1;\n\n// Mesh\nborder ba(t=0, 1){x=t; y=0; label=1;}\nborder bb(t=0,

Poisson;\n    Th = adaptmesh(Th, u, err=error);\n    error = error/2;\n}\n\n// Plot\nplot(u);\n\n\nTo speed up the adaptation, the default parameter err of adaptmesh is changed by hand; it specifies the required precision, so as to make the new mesh finer or coarser.\nThe problem is coercive and symmetric, so the linear system can be solved with the conjugate gradient method (parameter solver=CG) with the stopping criteria on the residual, here eps=1.e-6).\nBy adaptmesh, the slope of the final solution is correctly computed near the point of intersection of \\(bc\\) and \\(bd\\) as in Fig. 16.\nThis method is described in detail in [HECHT1998].\nIt has a number of default parameters which can be modified.\nIf f1,f2 are functions and thold, Thnew are meshes:\nThnew = adaptmesh(Thold, f1 ... );\nThnew = adaptmesh(Thold, f1,f2 ... ]);\nThnew = adaptmesh(Thold, [f1,f2] ... );\n\n\nThe additional parameters of adaptmesh are:\nSee Reference part for more inforamtions\n\n\nhmin= Minimum edge size.Its default is related to the size of the domain to be meshed and the precision of the mesh generator.\n\n\n\n\nhmax= Maximum edge size.It defaults to the diameter of the domain to be meshed.\n\n\n\nerr= \\(P_1\\) interpolation error level (0.01 is the default).\n\n\nerrg= Relative geometrical error.By default this error is 0.01, and in any case it must be lower than \\(1/\\sqrt{2}\\).\nMeshes created with this option may have some edges smaller than the -hmin due to geometrical constraints.\n\n\n\nnbvx= Maximum number of vertices generated by the mesh generator (9000 is the default).\n\nnbsmooth= number of iterations of the smoothing procedure (5 is the default).\n\nnbjacoby= number of iterations in a smoothing procedure during the metric construction, 0 means no smoothing, 6 is the default.\n\n\nratio= ratio for a prescribed smoothing on the metric.If the value is 0 or less than 1.1 no smoothing is done on the metric. 1.8 is the default.\nIf ratio > 1.1, the speed of mesh size variations is bounded by \\(log(\\mathtt{ratio})\\).\n\nNote\nAs ratio gets closer to 1, the number of generated vertices increases.\nThis may be useful to control the thickness of refined regions near shocks or boundary layers.\n\n\n\n\nomega= relaxation parameter for the smoothing procedure. 1.0 is the default.\n\niso= If true, forces the metric to be isotropic. false is the default.\n\n\nabserror= If false, the metric is evaluated using the criteria of equi-repartion of relative error.false is the default.\nIn this case the metric is defined by:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{M} = \\left({1\\over\\mathtt{err}\\,\\, \\mathtt{coef}^2} \\quad {\n|\\mathcal{H}| \\over max(\\mathtt{CutOff},|\\eta|)}\\right)^p\\]\nOtherwise, the metric is evaluated using the criteria of equi-distribution of errors.\nIn this case the metric is defined by:\n\n\\[\\mathcal{M} = \\left({1\\over \\mathtt{err}\\,\\,\\mathtt{coef}^2} \\quad\n{|{\\mathcal{H}|} \\over\n{\\sup(\\eta)-\\inf(\\eta)}}\\right)^p.\\label{eq err abs}\\]\n\n\n\ncutoff= lower limit for the relative error evaluation.\n1.0e-6 is the default.\n\n\nverbosity= informational messages level (can be chosen between 0 and \\(\\infty\\)).Also changes the value of the global variable verbosity (obsolete).\n\n\n\ninquire= To inquire graphically about the mesh.\nfalse is the default.\n\n\nsplitpbedge= If true, splits all internal edges in half with two boundary vertices.true is the default.\n\n\n\n\nmaxsubdiv= Changes the metric such that the maximum subdivision of a background edge is bound by val.Always limited by 10, and 10 is also the default.\n\n\n\n\nrescaling= if true, the function, with respect to which the mesh is adapted, is rescaled to be between 0 and 1.true is the default.\n\n\n\n\nkeepbackvertices= if true, tries to keep as many vertices from the original mesh as possible.true is the default.\n\n\n\n\nIsMetric= if true, the metric is defined explicitly.false is the default.\nIf the 3 functions \\(m_{11}, m_{12}, m_{22}\\) are given, they directly define a symmetric matrix field whose Hessian is computed to define a metric.\nIf only one function is given, then it represents the isotropic mesh size at every point.\nFor example, if the partial derivatives fxx (\\(=\\partial^2 f/\\partial x^2\\)), fxy (\\(=\\partial^2 f/\\partial x\\partial y\\)), fyy (\\(=\\partial^2 f/\\partial y^2\\)) are given, we can set Th = adaptmesh(Th, fxx, fxy, fyy, IsMetric=1, nbvx=10000, hmin=hmin);\n\n\n\n\npower= exponent power of the Hessian used to compute the metric.1 is the default.\n\n\n\n\nthetamax= minimum corner angle in degrees.Default is \\(10^\\circ\\) where the corner is \\(ABC\\) and the angle is the angle of the two vectors \\({AB}, {BC}\\), (\\(0\\) imply no corner, \\(90\\) imply perpendicular corner, …).\n\n\n\n\nsplitin2= boolean value.If true, splits all triangles of the final mesh into 4 sub-triangles.\n\n\n\n\nmetric= an array of 3 real arrays to set or get metric data information.The size of these three arrays must be the number of vertices.\nSo if m11,m12,m22 are three P1 finite elements related to the mesh to adapt, you can write: metric=[m11[],m12[],m22[]] (see file convect-apt.edp for a full example)\n\n\n\nnomeshgeneration= If true, no adapted mesh is generated (useful to compute only a metric).\n\n\nperiodic= Writing periodic=[[4,y],[2,y],[1,x],[3,x]]; builds an adapted periodic mesh.The sample builds a biperiodic mesh of a square.\n(see periodic finite element spaces, and see the Sphere example for a full example)\n\n\n\n\nWe can use the command adaptmesh to build a uniform mesh with a constant mesh size.\nTo build a mesh with a constant mesh size equal to \\(\\frac{1}{30}\\) try:\nmesh Th=square(2, 2); //the initial mesh\nplot(Th, wait=true, ps=\"square-0.eps\");\n\nTh = adaptmesh(Th, 1./30., IsMetric=1, nbvx=10000);\nplot(Th, wait=true, ps=\"square-1.eps\");\n\nTh = adaptmesh(Th, 1./30., IsMetric=1, nbvx=10000); //More the one time du to\nTh = adaptmesh(Th, 1./30., IsMetric=1, nbvx=10000); //Adaptation bound `maxsubdiv=`\nplot(Th, wait=true, ps=\"square-2.eps\");\n\n\n\n\nFig. 17 Initial mesh\n\n\n\nFig. 18 First iteration\n\n\n\nFig. 19 Last iteration\n\n\n\nTrunc¶\nTwo operators have been introduced to remove triangles from a mesh or to divide them.\nOperator trunc has two parameters:\n\nlabel= sets the label number of new boundary item, one by default.\n\nsplit= sets the level \\(n\\) of triangle splitting.Each triangle is split in \\(n\\times n\\), one by default.\n\n\n\nTo create the mesh Th3 where all triangles of a mesh Th are split in \\(3{\\times}3\\), just write:\nmesh Th3 = trunc(Th, 1, split=3);\n\n\nThe following example construct all “trunced” meshes to the support of the basic function of the space Vh (cf. abs(u)>0), split all the triangles in \\(5{\\times} 5\\), and put a label number to \\(2\\) on a new boundary.\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(3, 3);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=0;\n\n// Loop on all degrees of freedom\nint n=u.n;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++){\n    u[][i] = 1; // The basis function i\n    plot(u, wait=true);\n    mesh Sh1 = trunc(Th, abs(u)>1.e-10, split=5, label=2);\n    plot(Th, Sh1, wait=true, ps=\"trunc\"+i+\".eps\");\n    u[][i] = 0; // reset\n}\n\n\n\n\nFig. 20 Mesh of support the function P1 number 0, split in \\(5{\\times}5\\)\n\n\n\nFig. 21 Mesh of support the function P1 number 6, split in \\(5{\\times}5\\)\n\n\n\nSplitmesh¶\nAnother way to split mesh triangles is to use splitmesh, for example:\n// Mesh\nborder a(t=0, 2*pi){x=cos(t); y=sin(t); label=1;}\nmesh Th = buildmesh(a(20));\nplot(Th, wait=true, ps=\"NotSplittedMesh.eps\");\n\n// Splitmesh\nTh = splitmesh(Th, 1 + 5*(square(x-0.5) + y*y));\nplot(Th, wait=true, ps=\"SplittedMesh.eps\");\n\n\n\n\nFig. 22 Initial mesh\n\n\n\nFig. 23 All left mesh triangle is split conformaly in

elements of a mesh¶\nChanging the label of elements and border elements will be done using the keyword change.\nThe parameters for this command line are for two dimensional and three dimensional cases:\n\nlabel = is a vector of integer that contains successive pairs of the old label number to the new label number.\nregion = is a vector of integer that contains successive pairs of the old region number to new region number.\nflabel = is an integer function given the new value of the label.\nfregion= is an integer function given the new value of the region.\n\nThese vectors are composed of \\(n_{l}\\) successive pairs of numbers \\(O,N\\) where \\(n_{l}\\) is the number (label or region) that we want to change.\nFor example, we have :\n\n(2)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\mathtt{label} &= [ O_{1}, N_{1}, ..., O_{n_{l}},N_{n_{l}} ] \\\\\n\\mathtt{region} &= [ O_{1}, N_{1}, ..., O_{n_{l}},N_{n_{l}} ]\\end{split}\\]\nAn example of using this function is given here:\nverbosity=3;\n\n//

operator “+” between meshes.\nThe method implemented needs the point in adjacent meshes to be the same.\n\n\nMesh in three dimensions¶\n\n\n\nCube¶\nA new function cube like the function square in 2d

denotes the number of vertices, \\(n_{tet}\\) the number of tetrahedra and \\(n_{tri}\\) the number of triangles.\nFor each vertex \\(q^i,\\, i=1,\\cdots,n_v\\), we denote by \\((q^i_x,q^i_y,q^i_z)\\) the \\(x\\)-coordinate, the \\(y\\)-coordinate and the \\(z\\)-coordinate.\nEach tetrahedra \\(T_k, k=1,\\cdots,n_{tet}\\) has four vertices \\(q^{k_1},\\, q^{k_2},\\,q^{k_3}, \\,q^{k_4}\\).\nThe

dimensional mesh is composed of the data structure presented in Mesh Format section and a data structure for the tetrahedra. The tetrahedra of a three dimensional mesh are referred using the following field:\nTetrahedra\nNbTetrahedra\nVertex1 Vertex2 Vertex3 Vertex4 Label\n...\nVertex1 Vertex2 Vertex3 Vertex4 Label\n\n\nThis field is express with the notation of Mesh Format section.\n\n\nTetGen: A tetrahedral mesh generator¶\nTetGen\nTetGen is a software developed by Dr. Hang Si of Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics in Berlin, Germany [HANG2006].\nTetGen is free for research and non-commercial use.\nFor any commercial license utilization, a commercial license is available upon request to Hang Si.\nThis software is a tetrahedral mesh generator of a three dimensional domain defined by its boundary.\nThe input domain takes into account a polyhedral or a piecewise linear complex.\nThis tetrahedralization is a constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization.\nThe method used in TetGen to control the quality of the mesh is a Delaunay refinement due to Shewchuk [SHEWCHUK1998].\nThe quality measure of this algorithm is the Radius-Edge Ratio (see Section 1.3.1 [HANG2006] for more details).\nA theoretical bound of this ratio of the Shewchuk algorithm is obtained for a given complex of vertices, constrained segments and facets of surface mesh, with no input angle less than 90 degrees.\nThis theoretical bound is 2.0.\nThe launch of TetGen is done with the keyword tetg.\nThe parameters of this command line is:\n\nreftet= sets the label of tetrahedra.\n\n\nlabel= is a vector of integers that contains the old labels number at index \\(2i\\) and the new labels number at index \\(2i+1\\) of Triangles.This parameter is initialized as a label for the keyword change.\n\n\n\n\nswitch= A string expression.This string corresponds to the command line switch of TetGen see Section 3.2 of [HANG2006].\n\n\n\nnbofholes= Number of holes (default value: “size of holelist / 3”).\n\n\nholelist= This array corresponds to holelist of TetGenio data structure [HANG2006].A real vector of size 3 * nbofholes.\nIn TetGen, each hole is associated with a point inside this domain.\nThis vector is \\(x_{1}^{h}, y_{1}^{h}, z_{1}^{h}, x_{2}^{h}, y_{2}^{h}, z_{2}^{h}, \\cdots,\\) where \\(x_{i}^{h},y_{i}^{h},z_{i}^{h}\\) is the associated point with the \\(i^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) hole.\n\n\n\nnbofregions= Number of regions (default value: “size of regionlist / 5”).\n\nregionlist= This array corresponds to regionlist of TetGenio data structure [HANG2006].\nThe attribute and the volume constraint of region are given in this real vector of size 5 * nbofregions.\nThe \\(i^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) region is described by five elements: \\(x-\\)coordinate, \\(y-\\)coordinate and \\(z-\\)coordinate of a point inside this domain (\\(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}\\)); the attribute (\\(at_{i}\\)) and the maximum volume for tetrahedra (\\(mvol_{i}\\)) for this region.\nThe regionlist vector is: \\(x_{1}, y_{1}, z_{1}, at_{1}, mvol_{1}, x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2}, at_{2}, mvol_{2}, \\cdots\\).\n\nnboffacetcl= Number of facets constraints “size of facetcl / 2”).\n\nfacetcl= This array corresponds to facetconstraintlist of TetGenio data structure [HANG2006].\nThe \\(i^{th}\\) facet constraint is defined by the facet marker \\(Ref_{i}^{fc}\\) and the maximum area for faces \\(marea_{i}^{fc}\\).\nThe facetcl array is: \\(Ref_{1}^{fc}, marea_{1}^{fc}, Ref_{2}^{fc}, marea_{2}^{fc}, \\cdots\\).\nThis parameters has no effect if switch q is not selected.\n\n\nPrincipal switch parameters in TetGen:\n\np Tetrahedralization of boundary.\n\n\nq Quality mesh generation.The bound of Radius-Edge Ratio will be given after the option q.\nBy default, this value is 2.0.\n\n\n\n\na Constructs with the volume constraints on tetrahedra.These volumes constraints are defined with the bound of the previous switch q or in the parameter regionlist.\n\n\n\n\nA Attributes reference to region given in the regionlist.The other regions have label 0.\n\n\nThe option AA gives a different label at each region.\nThis switch works with the option p.\nIf option :freefem`r` is used, this switch has no effect.\n\n\nr Reconstructs and Refines a previously generated mesh.This character is only used with the command line tetgreconstruction.\n\n\n\nY This switch preserves the mesh on the exterior boundary.\nThis switch must be used to ensure a conformal mesh between two adjacent meshes.\n\nYY This switch preserves the mesh on the exterior and interior boundary.\n\nC The consistency of the result’s mesh is testing by TetGen.\n\nCC The consistency of the result’s mesh is testing by TetGen and also constrained checks of Delaunay mesh (if p switch is selected) or the consistency of Conformal Delaunay (if q switch is selected).\n\n\nV Give information of the work of TetGen.More information can be obtained in specified VV or VVV.\n\n\n\nQ Quiet: No terminal output except errors\n\nM The coplanar facets are not merging.\n\n\nT Sets a tolerance for coplanar test.The default value is \\(1e-8\\).\n\n\n\nd Intersections of facets are detected.\n\n\nTo obtain a tetrahedral mesh with TetGen, we need the surface mesh of a three dimensional domain.\nWe now give the command line in FreeFem++ to construct these meshes.\nkeyword: movemesh23\nA simple method to construct a surface is to place a two dimensional domain in a three dimensional space.\nThis corresponds to moving the domain by a displacement vector of this form \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi(x,y)} = (\\Phi1(x,y), \\Phi2(x,y), \\Phi3(x,y))\\).\nThe result of moving a two dimensional mesh Th2 by this three dimensional displacement is obtained using:\nmesh3 Th3 = movemesh23(Th2, transfo=[Phi(1), Phi(2), Phi(3)]);\n\n\nThe parameters of this command line are:\n\ntransfo= [\\(\\Phi 1\\), \\(\\Phi 2\\), \\(\\Phi 3\\)] sets the displacement vector of transformation \\(\\mathbf{\\Phi(x,y)} = [\\Phi1(x,y), \\Phi2(x,y), \\Phi3(x,y)]\\).\n\nlabel= sets an integer label of triangles.\n\norientation= sets an integer orientation of mesh.\n\n\nptmerge= A real expression.When you transform a mesh, some points can be merged.\nThis parameter is the criteria to define two merging points.\nBy default, we use\n\n\\[ptmerge \\: = \\: 1e-7 \\: \\:Vol( B ),\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(B\\) is the smallest axis, parallel boxes containing the discretized domain of \\(\\Omega\\) and \\(Vol(B)\\) is the volume of this box.\n\n\nWe can do a “gluing” of surface meshes using the process given in Change section.\nAn example to obtain a three dimensional mesh using the command line tetg and movemesh23 is given below.\nload \"msh3\"\nload \"tetgen\"\n\n// Parameters\nreal x10 = 1.;\nreal x11 = 2.;\nreal y10 = 0.;\nreal y11 = 2.*pi;\n\nfunc ZZ1min = 0;\nfunc ZZ1max = 1.5;\nfunc

movemesh23(Th2, transfo=[Phi(1), Phi(2), Phi(3)]) and Th2 is the input two dimensional mesh of tetgtransfo.\nThe parameters of this command line are, on one hand, the parameters label, switch, regionlist, nboffacetcl, facetcl of keyword tetg and on the other hand, the parameter ptmerge of keyword movemesh23.\n\nNote\nTo use tetgtransfo, the result’s mesh of movemesh23 must be a closed

Therefore, the parameter regionlist is defined for one region.\nAn example of this keyword can be found in line 61 of the Build layer mesh example.\n\nThe keyword tetgconvexhull\nFreeFem++, using TetGen, is able to build a tetrahedralization from a set of points.\nThis tetrahedralization is a Delaunay mesh of the convex hull of the set of points.\nThe coordinates of the points can be initialized in two ways.\nThe first is a file that contains the coordinate of points \\(X_{i}=(x_{i}, y_{i}, z_{i})\\).\nThis file is organized as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{ccc}\nn_{v} & & \\\\\nx_{1} & y_{1} & z_{1} \\\\\nx_{2} & y_{2} & z_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots &\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_{n_v} & y_{n_v} & z_{n_v}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThe second way is to give three arrays that correspond respectively to the \\(x-\\)coordinates, \\(y-\\)coordinates and \\(z-\\)coordinates.\nThe parameters of this command line are :\n\n\nswitch= A string expression.This string corresponds to the command line switch of TetGen see Section 3.2 of [HANG2006].\n\n\n\nreftet= An integer expression.Set the label of tetrahedra.\n\n\n\nlabel= An integer expression.Set the label of triangles.\n\n\n\nIn the string switch, we can’t used the option p and q of TetGen.\n\n\nReconstruct/Refine a three dimensional mesh with TetGen¶\nMeshes in three dimension can be refined using TetGen with the command line tetgreconstruction.\nThe parameter of this keyword are\n\n\nregion= an integer array that changes the region number of tetrahedra.This array is defined as the parameter reftet in the keyword change.\n\n\n\nlabel= an integer array that changes the label of boundary triangles.This array is defined as the parameter label in the keyword change.\n\n\n\nsizeofvolume= a reel function.This function constraints the volume size of the tetrahedra in the domain (see Isotrope mesh adaption section to build a 3d adapted mesh).\n\n\n\nThe parameters switch, nbofregions, regionlist, nboffacetcl and facetcl of the command line which call TetGen (tetg) is used for tetgrefine.\nIn the parameter switch=, the character r should be used without the character p.\nFor instance, see the manual of TetGen [HANG2006] for effect of r to other character.\nThe parameter regionlist defines a new volume constraint in the region.\nThe label in the regionlist will be the previous label of region.\nThis parameter and nbofregions can’t be used with the parameter sizeofvolume.\nExample refinesphere.edp\nload \"msh3\"\nload \"TetGen\"\nload \"medit\"\n\nmesh Th = square(10, 20, [x*pi-pi/2, 2*y*pi]);

Like sequential, parallel linear solvers can be direct or iterative. In FreeFem++ both are available.\n\nUsing parallel sparse solvers in FreeFem++¶\nWe recall that the solver parameters are defined in the following commands: solve, problem, set (setting parameter of a matrix) and in the construction of the matrix corresponding to a bilinear form.\nIn these commands, the parameter solver must be set to sparsesolver for parallel sparse solver.\nWe have added specify parameters to these command lines for parallel sparse solvers.\nThese are:\n\nlparams : vector of integer parameters (l is for the C++ type long)\ndparams : vector of real parameters\nsparams : string parameters\ndatafilename : name of the file which contains solver parameters\n\nThe following four parameters are only for direct solvers and are vectors.\nThese parameters allow the user to preprocess the matrix (see the section on sparse direct solver for more information).\n\npermr : row permutation (integer vector)\npermc : column permutation or inverse row permutation (integer vector)\nscaler : row scaling (real vector)\nscalec : column scaling (real vector)\n\nThere are two possibilities to control solver parameters.\nThe first method defines parameters with lparams, dparams and sparams in .edp file.\nThe second one reads the solver parameters from a data file. The name of this file is specified by datafilename.\nIf lparams, dparams, sparams or datafilename is not provided by the user, the solver’s default values are used.\nTo use parallel solver in FreeFem++, we need to load the dynamic library corresponding to this solver.\nFor example to use MUMPS solver as parallel solver in FreeFem++, write in the .edp file load \"MUMPS_FreeFem\".\nIf the libraries are not loaded, the default sparse solver will be loaded (default sparse solver is UMFPACK). The Table 2 gives this new value for the different libraries.\n\nTable 2 Default sparse solver for real and complex arithmetics when we load a parallel sparse solver library¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibraries\nDefault sparse solver\n\n \nreal\ncomplex\n\n\n\nMUMPS_FreeFem\nmumps\nmumps\n\nreal_SuperLU_DIST_FreeFem\nSuperLU_DIST\nprevious solver\n\ncomplex_SuperLU_DIST_FreeFem\nprevious solver\nSuperLU_DIST\n\nreal_pastix_FreeFem\nPaStiX\nprevious solver\n\ncomplex_pastix_FreeFem\nprevious solver\nPaStiX\n\nhips_FreeFem\nhips\nprevious solver\n\nhypre_FreeFem\nhypre\nprevious solver\n\nparms_FreeFem\nparms\nprevious solver\n\n\n\nWe also add functions (see Table 3) with no parameter to change the default sparse solver in the .edp file.\nTo use these functions, we need to load the library corresponding to the solver.\nAn example of using different parallel sparse solvers for the same problem is given in Direct solvers example.\n\nTable 3 Functions that allow to change the default sparse solver for real and complex arithmetics and the result of these functions¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\ndefault sparse solver\n\n \nreal\ncomplex\n\n\n\ndefaulttoMUMPS()\nmumps\nmumps\n\nrealdefaulttoSuperLUdist()\nSuperLU_DIST\nprevious solver\n\ncomplexdefaulttoSuperLUdist()\nprevious solver\nSuperLU_DIST\n\nrealdefaultopastix()\npastix\nprevious solver\n\ncomplexdefaulttopastix()\nprevious solver\npastix\n\ndefaulttohips()\nhips\nprevious solver\n\ndefaulttohypre()\nhypre\nprevious solver\n\ndefaulttoparms()\nparms\nprevious solver\n\n\n\n\nTip\nTest direct solvers\nload \"MUMPS_FreeFem\"\n//default solver: real-> MUMPS, complex -> MUMPS\nload \"real_SuperLU_DIST_FreeFem\"\n//default solver: real-> SuperLU_DIST,\ncomplex -> MUMPS load \"real_pastix_FreeFem\"\n//default solver: real-> pastix, complex -> MUMPS\n\n// Solving with pastix\n{\n    matrix A =\n        [[1, 2, 2, 1, 1],\n        [ 2, 12, 0, 10, 10],\n        [ 2, 0, 1, 0, 2],\n        [ 1, 10, 0, 22, 0.],\n        [ 1, 10, 2, 0., 22]];\n\n    real[int] xx = [1, 32, 45, 7, 2], x(5), b(5), di(5);\n    b = A*xx;\n    cout << \"b =\" << b << endl;

INCTL(18)).\nThe different values of ICNTL(5) are 0 for assembled format and 1 for element format.\nIn the current release of FreeFem++, we consider that FE matrix or matrix is storage in assembled format.\nTherefore, INCTL(5) is treated as 0 value.\nThe main option for ICNTL(18): INCLTL(18)=0 centrally on the host processor, ICNTL(18)=3 distributed the input matrix pattern and the entries (recommended option for distributed matrix by developer of MUMPS).\nFor other values of ICNTL(18) see the MUMPS user’s guide.\nThese values can be used also in FreeFem++.\nThe default option implemented in FreeFem++ are ICNTL(5)=0 and ICNTL(18)=0.\n\n\n\nPreprocessing parameter The preprocessed matrix \\(A_{p}\\) that will be effectively factored is defined by\n\n\n\\[A_{p} = P \\: D_r \\: A \\: Q_c \\ D_c P^t\\]\nwhere \\(P\\) is the permutation matrix, \\(Q_c\\) is the column permutation, \\(D_r\\) and \\(D_c\\) are diagonal matrix for respectively row and column scaling.\nThe ordering strategy to obtain \\(P\\) is controlled by parameter ICNTL(7).\nThe permutation of zero free diagonal \\(Q_c\\) is controlled by parameter ICNTL(6).\nThe row and column scaling is controlled by parameter ICNTL(18).\nThese option are connected and also strongly related with ICNTL(12) (see the MUMPS user’s guide for more details).\nThe parameters permr, scaler, and scalec in FreeFem++ allow to give permutation matrix(\\(P\\)), row scaling (\\(D_r\\)) and column scaling (\\(D_c\\)) of the user respectively.\n\n\n\nCalling MUMPS in FreeFem++\nTo call MUMPS in FreeFem++, we need to load the dynamic library MUMPS_freefem.dylib (MacOSX), MUMPS_freefem.so (Unix) or MUMPS_freefem.dll (Windows).\nThis is done in typing load \"MUMPS_FreeFem\" in the .edp file. We give now the two methods to give the option of MUMPS solver in FreeFem++.\n\n\nSolver parameters is defined in .edp file: In this method, we need to give the parameters lparams and dparams.These parameters are defined for MUMPS by :\n\n\nlparams[0] = SYM, lparams[1] = PAR,\n\\(\\forall i\\) = 1,…,40, lparams[i+1] = ICNTL(i)\n\\(\\forall i\\) = 1,…,15, dparams[i-1] = CNTL(i)\n\n\n\n\n\nReading solver parameters on a file:\n\nThe structure of data file for MUMPS in FreeFem++ is : first line parameter SYM and second line parameter PAR and in the following line the different value of vectors

factorization.\nIt is a free scientific library\nThis library provides functions to handle square or rectangular matrix in real and complex arithmetics.\nThe method implemented in SuperLU_DIST is a supernodal method.\nNew release of this package includes a parallel symbolic factorization.\nThis scientific library is written in C and MPI for communications.\nSuperLU_DIST parameters:\nWe describe now some parameters of SuperLU_DIST.\nThe SuperLU_DIST library use a 2D-logical process group.\nThis process grid is specified by \\(nprow\\) (process row) and \\(npcol\\) (process column) such that \\(N_{p} = nprow \\: npcol\\) where \\(N_{p}\\) is the number of all process allocated for SuperLU_DIST.\nThe input matrix parameters is controlled by “matrix=” in sparams for internal parameter or in the third line of parameters file.\nThe different value are\n\nmatrix=assembled global matrix are available on all process\nmatrix=distributedglobal The global matrix is distributed among all the process\nmatrix=distributed The input matrix is distributed (not yet implemented)\n\nThe option arguments of SuperLU_DIST are described in the section Users-callable routine of the SuperLU users’ guide.\nThe parameter Fact and TRANS are specified in FreeFem++ interfaces to SuperLU_DIST during the different steps.\nFor this reason, the value given by the user for this option is not considered.\nThe factorization LU is calculated in SuperLU_DIST on the matrix \\(A_p\\).\n\n\\[A_{p} = P_{c} \\: P_r \\: D_r \\: A \\: D_{c} \\: P_{c}^{t}\\]\nwhere \\(P_c\\) and \\(P_r\\) is the row and column permutation matrix respectively, \\(D_r\\) and \\(D_c\\) are diagonal matrix for respectively row and column scaling.\nThe option argument RowPerm (resp. ColPerm) control the row (resp. column) permutation matrix.\n\\(D_r\\) and \\(D_c\\) is controlled by the parameter DiagScale.\nThe parameter permr, permc, scaler, and scalec in FreeFem++ is provided to give row permutation, column permutation, row scaling and column scaling of the user respectively.\nThe other parameters for LU factorization are ParSymFact and ReplaceTinyPivot.\nThe parallel symbolic factorization works only on a power of two processes and need the ParMetis ordering.\nThe default option argument of SuperLU_DIST are given in the file ffsuperlu_dist_fileparam.txt.\nCalling SuperLU_DIST in FreeFem++\nTo call SuperLU_DIST in FreeFem++, we need to load the library dynamic correspond to interface.\nThis done by the following line load \"real_superlu _DIST_FreeFem\" (resp. load \"complex_superlu_DIST_FreeFem\") for real (resp. complex) arithmetics in the file .edp.\nSolver parameters is defined in .edp file:\nTo call SuperLU_DIST with internal parameter, we used the

is a free scientific library under CECILL-C license.\nThis package solves sparse linear system with a direct and block ILU(k) iterative methods.\nhis solver can be applied to a real or complex matrix with a symmetric pattern.\nPaStiX parameters:\nThe input matrix parameter of FreeFem++ depend on PaStiX interface.\nmatrix = assembled for non distributed matrix.\nIt is the same parameter for SuperLU_DIST.\nThere are four parameters in PaStiX : iparm, dparm, perm and invp.\nThese parameters are respectively the integer parameters (vector of size 64), real parameters (vector of size 64), permutation matrix and inverse permutation matrix respectively.\niparm and dparm vectors are described in PaStiX RefCard.\nThe parameters permr and permc in FreeFem++ are provided to give permutation matrix and inverse permutation matrix of the user respectively.\nSolver parameters defined in .edp file:\nTo call PaStiX in FreeFem++ in this case, we need to specify the parameters lparams and dparams.\nThese parameters are defined by :\n\\(\\forall i\\) = 0,… ,63, lparams[i] = iparm[i].\n\\(\\forall i\\) = 0,… ,63, dparams[i] = dparm[i].\nReading solver parameters on a file:\nThe structure

iterative solvers, we have chosen pARMS, HIPS and Hypre.\nEach software implements a different type of parallel preconditioner.\nSo, pARMS implements algebraic domain decomposition preconditioner type such as additive Schwartz [CAI1989] and interface method; while HIPS implement hierarchical incomplete factorization and finally HYPRE implements multilevel preconditioner are AMG(Algebraic MultiGrid) and parallel approximated inverse.\nTo use one of these programs in FreeFem++, you have to install it independently of FreeFem++.\nIt is also necessary to install the MPI communication library which is essential for communication between the processors and, in some cases, software partitioning graphs like METIS or Scotch.\nAll this preconditioners are used with Krylov subspace methods accelerators.\nKrylov subspace methods are iterative methods which consist in finding a solution \\(x\\) of linear system \\(Ax=b\\) inside the affine space \\(x_0+K_m\\) by imposing that \\(b-Ax \\bot \\mathcal{L}_m\\), where \\(K_m\\) is Krylov subspace of dimension \\(m\\) defined by \\(K_m=\\{r_0, Ar_0, A^2r_0,...,A^{m-1}r_0\\}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{L}_m\\) is another subspace of dimension \\(m\\) which depends on type of Krylov subspace. For example in GMRES, \\(\\mathcal{L}_m=AK_m\\).\nWe realized an interface which is easy to use, so that the call of these different softwares in FreeFem++ is done in the same way.\nYou just have to load the solver and then specify the parameters to apply to the specific solvers.\nIn the rest of this chapter, when we talk about Krylov subspace methods we mean one among GMRES, CG and BICGSTAB.\n\npARMS solver¶\npARMS (parallel Algebraic Multilevel Solver) is a software developed by Youssef Saad and al at University of Minnesota.\nThis software is specialized in the resolution of large sparse non symmetric linear systems of equation.\nSolvers developed in pARMS are of type “Krylov’s subspace”.\nIt consists of variants of GMRES like FGMRES (Flexible GMRES), DGMRES (Deflated GMRES) [SAAD2003] and BICGSTAB.\npARMS also implements parallel preconditioner like RAS (Restricted Additive Schwarz) [CAI1989] and Schur Complement type preconditioner.\nAll these parallel preconditioners are based on the principle of domain decomposition.\nThus, the matrix \\(A\\) is partitioned into sub matrices \\(A_i\\)(\\(i=1,...,p\\)) where p represents the number of partitions one needs.\nThe union of \\(A_i\\) forms the original matrix.\nThe solution of the overall system is obtained by solving the local systems on \\(A_i\\) (see [SMITH1996]).\nTherefore, a distinction is made between iterations on \\(A\\) and the local iterations on \\(A_i\\).\nTo solve the local problem on \\(A_i\\) there are several preconditioners as ilut (Incomplete LU with threshold), iluk (Incomplete LU with level of fill in) and ARMS (Algebraic Recursive Multilevel Solver).\n\nTip\nDefault parameters\nload \"parms_FreeFem\" //Tell FreeFem that you will use pARMS\n\n// Mesh\nborder

gain in time when we increase the number of processors used for the simulations.\nWe saw that in every case the time for the construction of the finite element matrix is constant.\nThis is normal because until now this phase is sequential in FreeFem++.\nIn contrast, phases for solving the linear system are parallel.\nWe saw on several examples presented here that when we increase the number of processors, in general we decrease the time used for solving the linear systems.\nBut this is not true in every case.\nIn several case, when we increase the number of processors the time to convergence also increases.\nThere are two main reasons for this.\nFirst, the increase of processors can lead to the increase of volume of exchanged data across processors consequently increasing the time for solving the linear systems.\nFurthermore, in decomposition domain type preconditioners, the number of processors generally corresponds to the number of sub domains.\nIn subdomain methods, generally when we increase the number of subdomains we decrease convergence quality of the preconditioner.\nThis can increase the time used for solving linear equations.\nTo end this, we should note that good use of the preconditioners interfaced in FreeFem++ is empiric, because it is difficult to know what is a good preconditioner for some type of problems.\nAlthough, the efficiency of preconditioners sometimes depends on how its parameters are set.\nFor this reason we advise the user to pay attention to the meaning of the parameters in the user guide of the iterative solvers interfaced in FreeFem++.\n\n\n\nDomain decomposition¶\nIn the previous section, we saw that the phases to construct a matrix are sequential.\nOne strategy to construct the matrix in parallel is to divide geometrically the domain into subdomains.\nIn every subdomain we construct a local submatrix and after that we assemble every submatrix to form the global matrix.\nWe can use this technique to solve PDE directly in domain \\(\\Omega\\).\nIn this case, in every subdomains you have to define artificial boundary conditions to form consistent equations in every subdomains.\nAfter this, you solve equation in every subdomains and define a strategy to obtain the global solution.\nIn terms of parallel programming for FreeFem++, with MPI, this means that the user must be able to divide processors avaible for computation into subgroups of processors and also must be able to realize different type of communications in FreeFem++ script.\nHere is a wrapper of some MPI functions.\n\nCommunicators and groups¶\nGroups\nmpiGroup grpe(mpiGroup gp, KN_<long>): Create MPI_Group from existing group gp by given vector.\nCommunicators\nCommunicators is an abstract MPI object which allows MPI user to communicate across group of processors.\nCommunicators can be Intra-communicators(involves a single group) or Inter-communicators (involves two groups).\nWhen we not specify

MPIrank.\nThis mean that do not use MPIrank in FreeFem++ script.\nprocessor(int rk): Keep process rank inside object MPIrank.\nRank is inside MPI_COMM_WORLD.\nprocessor(int rk, mpiComm cc) and processor(mpiComm cc, int rk) process rank inside communicator cc.\nprocessor(int rk, mpiComm cc) and processor(mpiComm cc, int rk) process rank inside communicator cc.\nprocessorblock(int rk): This function is exactlly the same than processor(int rk) but is use in case of blocking communication.\nprocessorblock(int rk, mpiComm cc): This function is exactly the same as processor(int rk, mpiComm cc) but uses a synchronization point.\n\n\nPoints to Points communicators¶\nIn FreeFem++ you can call MPI points to points communications functions.\nSend(processor(int rk, mpiComm cc), Data D) : Blocking send of Data D to processor of rank rk inside communicator cc.\nNote that Data D can be: int, real, complex, int[int], real[int], complex[int], Mesh, Mesh3, Matrix.\nRecv(processor(int rk,

and decrement the semaphore value by one (sem_wait).\nIf the value of a semaphore is currently zero, then a sem_wait operation will block until the value becomes greater than zero.\n\n\nThe functions of library\nFirst the semaphore interface to make synchronization:\n\ntypedef struct FF_P_sem *ff_Psem; the pointer to data structure\n\nff_Psem ffsem_malloc(); malloc an empty data structure\n\nvoid ffsem_del(ff_Psem sem); clean and free the pointer\n\nvoid ffsem_destroy(ff_Psem sem); clean, close the data structure\n\nvoid ffsem_init0(ff_Psem sem); make a correct empty of the data structure\n\nvoid ffsem_init(ff_Psem sem,const char *nmm, int crea); create or use a new semaphore\n\nlong ffsem_post(ff_Psem sem); nlocked, the value of the semaphore is incremented, and all threads which are waiting on the semaphore are awakened\n\nlong ffsem_wait(ff_Psem sem); the semaphore referenced by sem is locked.\nWhen calling sem_wait(), if the semaphore’s value is zero, the calling thread will block until the lock is acquired or until the call is interrupted by a signal.\nAlternatively, the sem_trywait() function will fail if the semaphore is already locked, rather than blocking on the semaphore\n\nlong ffsem_trywait(ff_Psem p);\n\n\nSecondly, the mmap functions:\n\ntypedef struct FF_P_mmap *ff_Pmmap; the pointer to data structure\nff_Psem ffmmap_malloc(); malloc an empty data structure\nvoid ffmmap_del(ff_Pmmap p); clean and free the pointer\nvoid ffmmap_destroy(ff_Pmmap p); clean, close the data structure\nvoid ffmmap_init0(ff_Pmmap p); make a correct empty of the data structure\nlong ffmmap_msync(ff_Pmmap p, long off, long ln); call writes modified whole pages back to the filesystem and updates the file modification time.\nOnly those pages containing addr and len-1 succeeding locations will be examined.\nvoid ffmmap_init(ff_Pmmap p, const char *nmm, long len); allocate memory, or map files or devices into memory.\nlong ffmmap_read(ff_Pmmap p, void *t, size_t n, size_t off); read n bytes from the mmap at memory off in pointer t.\nlong ffmmap_write(ff_Pmmap p, void *t, size_t n, size_t off); write n bytes to the mmap at memory off in pointer t.\n\nThe FreeFem++ corresponding functions:\n\nPmmap sharedata(filename, 1024); new type to store the mmap informations of name store in string filename with 1024 is the size the sharedata zone and file.\nPsemaphore smff(\"ff-slave\", creat); new type to store the semaphore of name ff-slave where creat is a boolean to create or use a existing semaphore.\nWait(sem) the semaphore referenced by sem is locked.\nWhen calling Wait(sem), if the semaphore’s value is zero, the calling thread will block until the lock is acquired or until the call is interrupted by a signal.\nAlternatively, the trywait(sem) function will fail if the semaphore is already locked, rather than blocking on the semaphore.\nPost(sem) the semaphore referenced by sem is unlocked, the value of the semaphore is incremented, and all threads which are waiting on the semaphore are awakened.\nRead(sharedata ,offset, data); read the variable data from the place offset in sharedata mmap.\nWrite(sharedata, offset, data); write the variable data at the place offset in sharedata mmap.\n\nThe full example:\nThe FFMaster.c file:\n#include \"libff-mmap-semaphore.h\"\n#include <unistd.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\nff_Psem sem_ff, sem_c;

Note that a refinement of the same can be obtained in combination with gnuplot\n\nTo change the color table and to choose the value of iso line you can do:\n// from: \\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space}\n// The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) model defines a color space\n// in terms of three constituent components:\n// HSV color space as a color wheel\n// Hue, the color type (such as red, blue, or yellow):\n// Ranges from 0-360 (but normalized to 0-100% in some applications, like here)\n// Saturation, the \"vibrancy\" of the color: Ranges from 0-100%\n// The lower the saturation of a color, the more \"grayness\" is present\n// and the more faded the color will appear.\n// Value, the brightness of the color: Ranges from 0-100%\n\nmesh Th = square(10, 10, [2*x-1, 2*y-1]);\n\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh uh=2-x*x-y*y;\n\nreal[int] colorhsv=[ // color hsv model\n   4./6., 1 , 0.5, // dark blue\n   4./6., 1 , 1, // blue\n   5./6., 1 , 1, // magenta\n   1, 1. , 1, // red\n   1, 0.5 , 1 // light red\n   ];\n real[int] viso(31);\n\n for (int i = 0; i < viso.n; i++)\n   viso[i] = i*0.1;\n\n plot(uh, viso=viso(0:viso.n-1), value=true, fill=true, wait=true, hsv=colorhsv);\n\n\n\n\nFig. 58 HSV color cylinder\n\n\n\nFig. 59 Isovalue with an other color table\n\n\nNote\nSee HSV example for the complete script.\n\n\n\nLink with gnuplot¶\nExample Membrane shows how to generate a gnuplot from a FreeFem++ file.\nHere is another technique which has the advantage of being online, i.e. one doesn’t need to quit FreeFem++ to generate a gnuplot.\nHowever, this works only if gnuplot is installed, and only on an Unix-like computer.\nAdd to the previous example:\n{// file for gnuplot\n   ofstream gnu(\"plot.gp\");\n   for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n      gnu << xx[i] << \" \" << yy[i] << endl;\n}\n\n// to call gnuplot command and wait 5 second (due to the Unix command)\n// and make postscript plot\nexec(\"echo 'plot \\\"plot.gp\\\" w l \\n pause 5 \\n set term postscript \\n set output \\\"gnuplot.eps\\\" \\n replot \\n quit' | gnuplot\");\n\n\n\n\nFig. 60 Plots a cut of uh with gnuplot\n\n\nNote\nSee Plot example for the complete script.\n\n\n\nLink with medit¶\nAs said above, medit is a freeware display package by Pascal Frey using OpenGL. Then you may run the following example.\nNow medit software is included in FreeFem++ under ffmedit name.\nThe medit command parameters are listed in the Reference part.\n\n\nFig. 61 :freefem:medit` plot\n\nWith version 3.2 or later\nload \"medit\"\n\nmesh Th = square(10, 10, [2*x-1, 2*y-1]);\n\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=2-x*x-y*y;\n\nmedit(\"u\", Th, u);\n\n\nBefore:\nmesh Th = square(10, 10, [2*x-1, 2*y-1]);\n\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=2-x*x-y*y;\n\nsavemesh(Th, \"u\", [x, y, u*.5]); //save u.points and u.faces file\n// build a u.bb file for medit\n{\n   ofstream file(\"u.bb\");\n   file << \"2 1 1 \" << u[].n << \" 2 \\n\";\n   for (int j = 0; j < u[].n; j++)\n      file << u[][j] << endl;\n}\n//call medit command\nexec(\"ffmedit u\");\n//clean files on unix-like OS\nexec(\"rm u.bb u.faces u.points\");\n\n\n\nNote\nSee Medit example for the complete script.\n\n\n\nLink with Paraview¶\nOne can also export mesh or results in the .vtk format in order to post-process data using Paraview.\nload \"iovtk\"\n\nmesh Th = square(10, 10, [2*x-1, 2*y-1]);\n\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=2-x*x-y*y;\n\nint[int] Order = [1];\nstring DataName = \"u\";\nsavevtk(\"u.vtu\", Th, u, dataname=DataName, order=Order);\n\n\n\n\nFig. 62 Paraview plot\n\n\nWarning\nFinite element variables saved using paraview must be in P0 or P1\n\n\nNote\nSee Paraview example for the complete script.\n\n\n\nLink with Matlab© and Octave¶\nIn order to create plots from FreeFem++ simulations in Octave and Matlab the FEM mesh and the FE function must be exported to text files:\nmesh Th = square(10, 10, [2*x-1, 2*y-1]);\n\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=2-x*x-y*y;\n\nsavemesh(Th,\"export_mesh.msh\");\n\nofstream file(\"export_data.txt\");\nfor (int j=0; j<u[].n; j++)\n   file << u[][j] << endl;\n\n\nWithin Matlab or Octave the files can be processed with the ffmatlib library:\naddpath('path to ffmatlib');\n[p,b,t]=ffreadmesh('export_mesh.msh');\nu=ffreaddata('export_data.txt');\nffpdeplot(p,b,t,'XYData',u,'ZStyle','continuous','Mesh','on');\ngrid;\n\n\n\n\nFig. 63 Matlab / Octave plot\n\n\nNote\nFor more Matlab / Octave plot examples have a look at the tutorial section Matlab / Octave Examples or visit the ffmatlib library on github.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","l":"documentation/visualization.html"},"15":{"t":"Authors","p":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            FreeFem++ documentation\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                FreeFem++ on GitHub\n            \n            \n                 stars -  forks\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nAuthors\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \nAuthors¶\n\n\n\n\n\nFrédéric Hecht\n\n\n\nProfessor at Laboratoire Jacques Louis\nLions (LJLL), Pierre and Marie\nCurie University, Paris\n\nfrederic.hecht@sorbonne-universite.fr\n\nhttps://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/hecht/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSylvain Auliac\n\n\n\nFormer PhD student at LJLL, optimization interface with\nnlopt,\nipopt,\ncmaes, …\n\nhttps://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/auliac/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlivier Pironneau\n\n\n\nProfessor of numerical analysis at the Paris VI university and at\nLJLL, numerical methods in fluid\n\nMember of the Institut Universitaire de\nFrance and Academie des\nSciences\n\nhttps://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/pironneau/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacques Morice\n\n\n\nFormer Post-Doc at LJLL, three dimensions mesh generation and\ncoupling with\nmedit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntoine Le Hyaric\n\n\n\nResearch engineer from CNRS, expert in\nsoftware engineering for scientific applications, electromagnetics\nsimulations, parallel computing and three-dimensionsal visualization\n\nhttps://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/lehyaric/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKohji Ohtsuka\n\n\n\nProfessor at Hiroshima Kokusai Gakuin\nUniversity, Japan and chairman of the\nWorld Scientific and Engineering Academy and\nSociety, Japan.

Under Linux and MacOS the install directory is one of the following /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/share/freefem++, /usr/local/lib/ff++\n\nWindows binary installation¶\nFirst download the windows installation executable, then double click to install FreeFem++.\nIn most cases just answer yes (or type return) to all questions.\nOtherwise in the Additional Task windows, check the box “Add application directory to your system path.” This is required otherwise the program ffglut.exe will not be found.\nBy now you should have two new icons on your desktop:\n\nFreeFem++ (VERSION).exe, the freefem++ application.\nFreeFem++ (VERSION) Examples, a link to the freefem++ examples folder.\n\nwhere (VERSION) is the version of the files (for example 3.59).\nBy default, the installed files are in C:\\Programs Files\\FreeFem++. In this directory, you have all the .dll files and other applications: FreeFem++-nw.exe, ffglut.exe, … The syntax for the command-line tools are the same as those of FreeFem.exe.\n\n\nMacOS X binary installation¶\nDownload the MacOS X binary version file, extract all the files by double clicking on the icon of the file, go the the directory and put the FreeFem+.app application in the /Applications directory.\nIf you want terminal access to FreeFem++ just copy the file FreeFem++ in a directory of your $PATH shell environment variable.\n\n\nArch AUR package¶\nAn up-to-date package of FreeFem++ for Arch is available on the Archlinux user repository.\nTo install it:\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/freefem++-git.git\ncd freefem++-git\nmakepkg -si\n\n\n\nNote\nThanks to Stephan Husmann\n\n\n\n\nCompilation¶\n\nBranches / OS status¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch\nLinux\nMacOSX\nWindows 7\n\n\n\nDevelop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompilation on OSX (>=10.13)¶\nRemark: Blocks of code are shell commands in terminal.\n\nInstall Xcode, Xcode Command Line tools and Xcode Additional Tools from the Apple website\n\nInstall gcc from http://hpc.sourceforge.net\ncurl -O http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/hpc/gfortran-7.1-bin.tar.gz?download\nsudo tar zxvf gfortran-7.1-bin.tar.gz -C /\n\n\n\nInstall autoconf and automake from macport or with Homebrew\nsudo port install autoconf\nsudo port install automake\n\n\n\nInstall mactex from ctan\n\nInstall the openmpi source code\n./configure CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc CXX=/usr/local/bin/g++ F77=/usr/local/bin/gfortran FC=/usr/local/bin/gfortran\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n\nInstall gsl\ncurl -O https://fr.mirror.babylon.network/gnu/gsl/gsl-2.4.tar.gz\ntar zxvf gsl-2.4.tar.gz\ncd gsl-2.4\n./configure CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n\n\nInstall git\n\nDownload the FreeFem++ source from the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/FreeFem/FreeFem-sources.git\n\n\n\n\n\nCompile FreeFem++.

global variables: verbosity, includepath, loadpath.\n\nNote\nThe variable verbosity changes the level of internal printing (0: nothing unless there are syntax errors, 1: few, 10: lots, etc. …), the default value is 2.\nThe included files are found in the includepath list and the load files are found in the loadpath list.\n\nThe syntax of the file is:\nverbosity = 5\nloadpath += \"/Library/FreeFem++/lib\"\nloadpath += \"/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/lib\"\nincludepath += \"/Library/FreeFem++/edp\"\nincludepath += \"/Users/hecht/Library/FreeFem++/edp\"\n# This is a comment\nload += \"funcTemplate\"\nload += \"myfunction\"\nload += \"MUMPS_seq\"\n\n\nThe possible paths for this file are\n\nunder Unix and MacOs\n\n/etc/freefem++.pref\n$(HOME)/.freefem++.pref\nfreefem++.pref\n\n\n\nunder windows\n\nfreefem++.pref\n\n\nWe can also use shell environment variables to change verbosity and the search rule before the init files.\nexport FF_VERBOSITY=50\nexport FF_INCLUDEPATH=\"dir;;dir2\"\nexport FF_LOADPATH=\"dir;;dir3\"\n\n\n\nNote\nThe separator between directories must be “;” and not “:” because “:” is used under Windows.\n\n\nNote\nTo show the list of init of FreeFem++ , do\nexport FF_VERBOSITY=100;\n./FreeFem++-nw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++

differential equation solver for non-linear multi-physics systems in 2D and 3D.\nProblems involving partial differential equations from several branches of physics, such as fluid-structure interactions, require interpolations of data on several meshes and their manipulation within one program.\nFreeFem++ includes a fast interpolation algorithm and a language for the manipulation of data on multiple meshes.\nFreeFem++ is written in C++ and its language is a C++ idiom.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n

\\bB, \\bC, \\stress\\) denote, respectively, the displacement field, the deformation gradient, the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor \\(\\bB = \\bF \\bF^T\\), the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor \\(\\bC =\\bF^T \\bF\\), and the Cauchy stress tensor.\nWe also introduce the symbols \\(I_1 := \\tr \\bC\\) and \\(J := \\det\\bF\\).\nUse will be made of the identity:\n\n\\[{\\PD{}J \\over \\PD{}\\bC} = J \\bC^{-1}\\]\nThe symbol \\(\\Id\\) denotes the identity tensor.\nThe symbol \\(\\Omega_{0}\\) denotes the reference configuration of the body to be deformed.\nThe unit volume in the reference (resp., deformed) configuration is denoted \\(dV\\) (resp., \\(dV_{0}\\)); these two are related by:\n\n\\[dV = J dV_{0},\\]\nwhich allows an integral over \\(\\Omega\\) involving the Cauchy stress \\(\\bT\\) to be rewritten as an integral of the Kirchhoff stress \\(\\kappa = J \\bT\\) over \\(\\Omega_{0}\\).\n\n\nRecommended References¶\nFor an exposition of nonlinear elasticity and of the underlying linear and tensor algebra, see [OGDEN1984].\nFor an advanced mathematical analysis of the Finite Element Method, see [RAVIART1998].\n\n\nA Neo-Hookean Compressible Material¶\nConstitutive Theory and Tangent Stress Measures\nThe strain energy density function is given by:\n\n\\[W = {\\mu \\over 2}(I_1 - \\tr \\Id - 2 \\ln J)\\]\n(see [HORGAN2004], formula (12)).\nThe corresponding 2nd Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor is given by:\n\n\\[\\bS_{n} := {\\PD{} W \\over \\PD{}\\bE} (\\bF_{n})\n=\n\\mu (\\Id - \\bC^{-1})\\]\nThe Kirchhoff stress, then, is:\n\n\\[\\kappa\n= \\bF \\bS \\bF^{T}\n= \\mu (\\bB - \\Id)\\]\nThe tangent Kirchhoff stress tensor at \\(\\bF_{n}\\) acting on \\(\\delta \\bF_{n+1}\\) is, consequently:\n\n\\[{\\PD{} \\kappa \\over \\PD{} \\bF} (\\bF_{n}) \\delta \\bF_{n+1}\n=\n\\mu\n\\left[\n\\bF_{n} (\\delta \\bF_{n+1})^T\n+\n\\delta \\bF_{n+1} (\\bF_{n})^T\n\\right]\\]\nThe Weak Form of the BVP in the Absence of Body (External) Forces\nThe \\(\\Omega_0\\) we are considering is an elliptical annulus, whose boundary consists of two concentric ellipses (each allowed to be a circle as a special case), with the major axes parallel.\nLet \\(P\\) denote the dead stress load (traction) on a portion \\(\\partial \\Omega_0^{t}\\) (= the inner ellipse) of the boundary \\(\\partial \\Omega_0\\).\nOn the rest of the boundary, we prescribe zero displacement.\nThe weak formulation of the boundary value problem is:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\arr{lll}\n0\n& = &\n\\int_{\\Omega_0}\n\\kappa[\\bF]\n\\:\n:\n\\:\n\\left\\{\n(\\Grad \\otimes \\mathbf{w}) (\\bF)^{-1}\n\\right\\}\\\\\n& - & \\int_{\\PD{} \\Omega_0^{t}} P \\cdot \\hat{N}_0\\\\\n\\rra\\end{split}\\]\nFor brevity, in the rest of this section we assume \\(P = 0\\).\nThe provided FreeFem++ code, however, does not rely on this assumption and allows for a general value and direction of \\(P\\).\nGiven a Newton approximation \\(\\mathbf{u}_n\\) of the displacement field \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) satisfying the BVP, we seek the correction \\(\\delta \\mathbf{u}_{n+1}\\) to obtain a better approximation:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{u}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}_{n} + \\delta \\mathbf{u}_{n+1}\\]\nby solving the weak formulation:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\arr{lll}\n    0 &=& \\int_{\\Omega_0}\\kappa[\\bF_{n} + \\delta \\bF_{n+1}]\\: :\\: \\left\\{(\\Grad \\otimes \\mathbf{w}) (\\bF_{n} + \\delta\\bF_{n+1})^{-1}\\right\\}- \\int_{\\PD{} \\Omega_0} P \\cdot \\hat{N}_0\\\\\n    &=& \\int_{\\Omega_0}\\left\\{\\kappa[\\bF_{n}] + {\\PD{} \\kappa \\over \\PD{} \\bF}[\\bF_{n}]\\delta \\bF_{n+1}\\right\\}\\: :\\: \\left\\{(\\Grad \\otimes \\mathbf{w})(\\bF_{n} + \\delta \\bF_{n+1})^{-1}\\right\\}\\\\\n    &=& \\int_{\\Omega_0}\\left\\{\\kappa[\\bF_{n}] + {\\PD{} \\kappa \\over \\PD{} \\bF}[\\bF_{n}]\\delta \\bF_{n+1}\\right\\}\\: :\\: \\left\\{(\\Grad \\otimes

\\mathbf{w})\n\\bF_{n}^{-1}\n\\right\\}\n\\\\\n\\rra\n\\quad\n\\mbox{for all test functions} \\mathbf{w},\\end{split}\\]\nwhere we have taken:\n\n\\[\\delta \\bF_{n+1} = \\Grad \\otimes \\delta \\mathbf{u}_{n+1}\\]\n\nNote\nContrary to standard notational use, the symbol \\(\\delta\\) here bears no variational context.\nBy \\(\\delta\\) we mean simply an increment in the sense of Newton’s Method.\nThe role of a variational virtual displacement here is played by \\(\\mathbf{w}\\).\n\n\n\nAn Approach to Implementation in FreeFem++¶\nIntroducing the code-like notation, where a string in \\(< >\\)’s is to be read as one symbol, the individual components of the tensor:\n\n\\[<TanK>\n :=\n{\\PD{} \\kappa \\over \\PD{} \\bF}[\\bF_{n}]\n\\delta \\bF_{n+1}\\]\nwill be implemented as the macros \\(<TanK11>\\), \\(<TanK12>\\), …\nThe individual components of the tensor quantities:\n\n\\[\\bD_{1} :=\n\\bF_{n} (\\delta \\bF_{n+1})^T\n+\n\\delta \\bF_{n+1} (\\bF_{n})^T,\\]\n\n\\[\\bD_{2} :=\n\\bF_{n}^{-T} \\delta \\bF_{n+1},\\]\n\n\\[\\bD_{3} :=\n(\\Grad \\otimes \\mathbf{w})\n\\bF_{n}^{-2} \\delta \\bF_{n+1},\\]\nand\n\n\\[\\bD_{4} :=\n(\\Grad \\otimes \\mathbf{w})\n\\bF_{n}^{-1},\\]\nwill be implemented as the macros:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\arr{l}\n<d1Aux11>, <d1Aux12>, \\quad \\ldots \\quad, <d1Aux22>,\\\\\n<d2Aux11>, <d2Aux12>, \\quad \\ldots

notation, the tangent Kirchhoff stress term becomes\n\n\\[{\\PD{} \\kappa \\over \\PD{} \\bF} (\\bF_{n})\n\\: \\delta \\bF_{n+1}\n=\n\\mu\n\\: \\bD_{1}\\]\nwhile the weak BVP formulation acquires the form:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\arr{lll}\n0 & =

conjugate gradient method.\n\nTip\nSchwarz conjugate gradient\nFirst, we construct the two domains:\n// Parameters\nint inside = 2; int outside = 1; int n = 4;\n\n// Mesh\nborder Gamma1(t=1, 2){x=t; y=0; label=outside;}\nborder Gamma2(t=0, 1){x=2; y=t; label=outside;}\nborder Gamma3(t=2, 0){x=t; y=1; label=outside;}\nborder GammaInside(t=1, 0){x=1-t; y=t; label=inside;}\nborder GammaArc(t=pi/2, 2*pi){x=cos(t); y=sin(t); label=outside;}\nmesh Th1 = buildmesh(Gamma1(5*n) + Gamma2(5*n) + GammaInside(5*n) + Gamma3(5*n));\nmesh Th2 = buildmesh(GammaInside(-5*n) + GammaArc(25*n));\nplot(Th1, Th2);\n\n\nNow, define the finite element spaces:\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh1(Th1, P1);\nVh1 u1, v1;\nVh1 lambda;\nVh1 p=0;\n\nfespace Vh2(Th2,P1);\nVh2 u2, v2;\n\n\n\nNote\nIt is impossible to define a function just on a part of boundary, so the \\(\\lambda\\) function must be defined on the all domain \\(\\Omega_1\\) such as:\nVh1 lambda;\n\n\n\nThe two Poisson’s problems:\nproblem Pb1 (u1, v1,

int1d(Th2, inside)(\n        - lambda*v2\n    )\n    + on(outside, u2=0)\n    ;\n\n\nAnd, we define a border matrix, because the \\(\\lambda\\) function is none zero inside the domain \\(\\Omega_1\\):\nvarf b(u2, v2, solver=CG) = int1d(Th1, inside)(u2*v2);\nmatrix B = b(Vh1, Vh1, solver=CG);\n\n\nThe boundary problem function,\n\n\\[\\lambda \\longrightarrow \\int_{\\Gamma_i

installation of FreeFem++; you need to have compiled ARPACK.\nThis tool is available in FreeFem++ if the word eigenvalue appears in line Load:, like:\n-- FreeFem++ v*.** (date *** *** ** **:**:** CET ****)\n file : ***.edp\n Load: lg_fem lg_mesh eigenvalue\n\n\nThis tool is based on arpack++, the object-oriented version of ARPACK eigenvalue package [LEHOUCQ1998].\nThe function EigenValue computes the generalized eigenvalue of \\(A u = \\lambda B u\\).\nThe Shift-invert method is used by default, with sigma =\\(\\sigma\\) the shift of the method.\nThe matrix \\(OP\\) is defined with \\(A - \\sigma B\\).\nThe return value is the number of converged eigenvalues (can be greater than the number of requested eigenvalues nev=)\nint k = EigenValue(OP, B, nev=Nev, sigma=Sigma);\n\n\nwhere the matrix \\(OP= A - \\sigma B\\) with a solver and boundary condition, and the matrix \\(B\\).\nThere is also a functional interface:\nint k = EigenValue(n, FOP1, FB, nev=Nev, sigma=Sigma);\n\n\nwhere \\(n\\) is the size of the problem, and the operators are now defined through functions, defining respectively the matrix product of \\(OP^{-1}\\) and \\(B\\), as in\nint n = OP1.n;\nfunc real[int] FOP1(real[int] & u){ real[int] Au = OP^-1*u; return Au; }\nfunc real[int] FB(real[int] & u){ real[int] Au = B*u; return Au; }\n\n\nIf you want finer control over the method employed in ARPACK, you can specify which mode ARPACK will work with (mode= , see ARPACK documentation [LEHOUCQ1998]). The operators necessary for the chosen mode can be passed through the optional parameters A=, A1=, B=, B1=, (see below).\n\nmode=1: Regular mode for solving \\(A u = \\lambda u\\)\nint k = EigenValue(n, A=FOP, mode=1, nev=Nev);\n\n\nwhere the function FOP defines the matrix product of A\n\nmode=2: Regular inverse mode for solving \\(A u = \\lambda B u\\)\nint k = EigenValue(n, A=FOP, B=FB, B1=FB1, mode=2, nev=Nev);\n\n\nwhere the functions FOP, FB and FB1 define respectively the matrix product of \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(B^{-1}\\)\n\nmode=3: Shift-invert mode for solving \\(A u = \\lambda B u\\)\nint k = EigenValue(n, A1=FOP1, B=FB, mode=3, sigma=Sigma, nev=Nev);\n\n\nwhere the functions FOP1 and FB define respectively the matrix product of \\(OP^{-1} = (A - \\sigma B)^{-1}\\) and \\(B\\)\n\n\nYou can also specify which subset of eigenvalues you want to compute (which=).\nThe default value is which=\"LM\", for eigenvalues with largest magnitude.\n\"SM\" is for smallest magnitude, \"LA\" for largest algebraic value, \"SA\" for smallest algebraic value, and \"BE\" for both ends of the spectrum.\nRemark: For complex problems, you need to use the keyword complexEigenValue instead of EigenValue when passing operators through functions.\n\nNote\nBoundary condition and Eigenvalue Problems\nThe locking (Dirichlet) boundary condition is make with exact penalization so we put 1e30=tgv on the diagonal term of the locked degree of freedom (see Finite element chapter). So take Dirichlet boundary condition just on \\(A\\) and not on \\(B\\) because we solve \\(w=OP^{-1}*B*v\\).\nIf you put locking (Dirichlet) boundary condition on \\(B\\) matrix (with key work on) you get small spurious modes \\((10^{-30})\\), due to boundary condition, but if you forget the locking boundary condition on \\(B\\) matrix (no keywork on) you get huge spurious \\((10^{30})\\) modes associated to these boundary conditons. We compute only small mode, so we get the good one in this case.\n\n\nsym= The problem is symmetric (all the eigen value are real)\n\nnev= The number desired eigenvalues (nev) close to the shift.\n\nvalue= The array to store the real part of the eigenvalues\n\nivalue= The array to store the imaginary part of the eigenvalues\n\nvector= The FE function array to store the eigenvectors\n\nrawvector= An array of type real[int,int] to store eigenvectors by column.\nFor real non symmetric problems, complex eigenvectors are given as two consecutive vectors, so if eigenvalue \\(k\\) and \\(k+1\\) are complex conjugate eigenvalues, the \\(k\\)th vector will contain the real part and the \\(k+1\\)th vector the imaginary part of the corresponding complex conjugate eigenvectors.\n\ntol= The relative accuracy to which eigenvalues are to be determined;\n\nsigma= The shift value;\n\nmaxit= The maximum number of iterations allowed;\n\nncv= The number of Arnoldi

the first example, we compute the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the Dirichlet problem on square \\(\\Omega=]0,\\pi[^2\\).\nThe problem is to find: \\(\\lambda\\), and \\(\\nabla u_{\\lambda}\\)

\\(\\lambda_{n,m} =(n^2+m^2), (n,m)\\in {\\mathbb{N}_*}^2\\) with the associated eigenvectors are \\(u_{{m,n}}=\\sin(nx)*\\sin(my)\\).\nWe use the generalized inverse shift mode of the arpack++

with undeformed shape \\(\\Omega\\times ]-h,h[\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), \\(\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2\\).\nBy the deformation of the plate, we assume that a point \\(P(x_1,x_2,x_3)\\) moves to \\({\\cal P}(\\xi_1,\\xi_2,\\xi_3)\\).\nThe vector \\(\\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2,u_3)=(\\xi_1-x_1,\\xi_2-x_2,\\xi_3-x_3)\\) is called the displacement vector.\nBy the deformation, the line segment \\(\\overline{\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}+\\tau\\Delta\\mathbf{x}}\\) moves approximately to \\(\\overline{\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}),\\mathbf{x}+\\tau\\Delta\\mathbf{x} +\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}+\\tau\\Delta\\mathbf{x})}\\) for small \\(\\tau\\), where \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3),\\, \\Delta\\mathbf{x} =(\\Delta x_1,\\Delta x_2,\\Delta x_3)\\).\nWe now calculate the ratio between two segments:\n\n\\[\\eta(\\tau)=\\tau^{-1}|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}|^{-1}\n\\left(|\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}+\\tau\\Delta\\mathbf{x})\n-\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})+\\tau\\Delta\\mathbf{x}|-\\tau|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}|\\right)\\]\nthen we have (see e.g. [NECAS2017], p.32)\n\n\\[\\lim_{\\tau\\to 0}\\eta(\\tau)=(1+2e_{ij}\\nu_i\\nu_j)^{1/2}-1,\n\\quad 2e_{ij}=\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_i}\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_j}+\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}+\n\\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu_i=\\Delta x_i|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}|^{-1}\\).\nIf the deformation is small, then we may consider that:\n\n\\[(\\partial u_k/\\partial x_i)(\\partial u_k/\\partial x_i)\\approx 0\\]\nand the following is called small strain tensor:\n\n\\[\\varepsilon_{ij}(u)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}+\n\\frac{\\partial u_j}{\\partial x_i}\\right)\\]\nThe tensor \\(e_{ij}\\) is called finite strain tensor.\nConsider the small plane \\(\\Delta \\Pi(\\mathbf{x})\\) centered at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) with the unit normal direction \\(\\mathbf{n}=(n_1,n_2,n_3)\\), then the surface on \\(\\Delta \\Pi(\\mathbf{x})\\) at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is:\n\n\\[(\\sigma_{1j}(\\mathbf{x})n_j, \\sigma_{2j}(\\mathbf{x})n_j, \\sigma_{3j}(\\mathbf{x})n_j)\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{ij}(\\mathbf{x})\\) is called stress tensor at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nHooke’s law is the assumption of a linear relation between \\(\\sigma_{ij}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) such as:\n\n\\[\\sigma_{ij}(\\mathbf{x})=c_{ijkl}(\\mathbf{x})\\varepsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{x})\\]\nwith the symmetry \\(c_{ijkl}=c_{jikl}, c_{ijkl}=c_{ijlk}, c_{ijkl}=c_{klij}\\).\nIf Hooke’s tensor \\(c_{ijkl}(\\mathbf{x})\\) do not depend on the choice of coordinate system, the material is called isotropic at \\(\\mathbf{x}\\).\nIf \\(c_{ijkl}\\) is constant, the material is called homogeneous.\nIn homogeneous isotropic case, there is Lamé constants \\(\\lambda, \\mu\\) (see e.g. [NECAS2017], p.43) satisfying\n\n\\[\\sigma_{ij}=\\lambda\\delta_{ij}\\textrm{div}\\mathbf{u}+2\\mu \\varepsilon_{ij}\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta_{ij}\\) is Kronecker’s delta.\nWe assume that the elastic plate is fixed on \\(\\Gamma_D\\times ]-h,h[,\\, \\Gamma_D\\subset \\partial\\Omega\\).\nIf the body force \\(\\mathbf{f}=(f_1,f_2,f_3)\\) is given in \\(\\Omega\\times]-h,h[\\) and surface force \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) is given in \\(\\Gamma_N\\times]-h,h[, \\Gamma_N=\\partial\\Omega\\setminus\\overline{\\Gamma_D}\\), then the equation of equilibrium is given as follows:\n\n(48)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    -\\partial_j \\sigma_{ij}&=&f_i~~\\textrm{in }\\Omega\\times ]-h,h[,\\quad\n    i=1,2,3\\\\\n    \\sigma_{ij}n_j&=&g_i~~\\textrm{on }\\Gamma_N\\times ]-h,h[,\\quad\n    u_i=0~~\\textrm{on }\\Gamma_D\\times ]-h,h[,\\quad i=1,2,3\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nWe now explain the plain elasticity.\n\nPlain strain:\nOn the end of plate, the contact condition \\(u_3=0,\\, g_3=\\) is satisfied.\nIn this case, we can suppose that \\(f_3=g_3=u_3=0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\\overline{u}(x_1,x_2)\\) for all \\(-h<x_3<h\\).\n\nPlain stress:\nThe cylinder is assumed to be very thin and subjected to no load on the ends \\(x_3=\\pm h\\), that is,\n\n\\[\\sigma_{3i}=0,\\quad x_3=\\pm h,\\quad i~1,2,3\\]\nThe assumption leads that \\(\\sigma_{3i}=0\\) in \\(\\Omega\\times ]-h,h[\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}(x_1,x_2,x_3)=\\overline{u}(x_1,x_2)\\) for all \\(-h<x_3<h\\).\n\nGeneralized plain stress:\nThe cylinder is subjected to no load at \\(x_3=\\pm h\\).\nIntroducing the mean values with respect to thickness,\n\n\\[\\overline{u}_i(x_1,x_2)=\\frac{1}{2h}\\int_{-h}^h{u(x_1,x_2,x_3)dx_3}\\]\nand we derive \\(\\overline{u}_3\\equiv 0\\).\nSimilarly we define the mean values \\(\\overline{f},\\overline{g}\\) of the body force and surface force as well as the mean values \\(\\overline{\\varepsilon}_{ij}\\) and \\(\\overline{\\sigma}_{ij}\\) of the components of stress and strain, respectively.\n\n\nIn what follows we omit the overlines of \\(\\overline{u}, \\overline{f},\\overline{g}, \\overline{\\varepsilon}_{ij}\\) and \\(\\overline{\\varepsilon}_{ij}\\).\nThen we obtain similar equation of equilibrium given in (48) replacing \\(\\Omega\\times ]-h,h[\\) with \\(\\Omega\\) and changing \\(i=1,2\\).\nIn the case of plane stress, \\(\\sigma_{ij}=\\lambda^* \\delta_{ij}\\textrm{div}u+2\\mu\\varepsilon_{ij}, \\lambda^*=(2\\lambda \\mu)/(\\lambda+\\mu)\\).\nThe equations of elasticity are naturally written in variational form for the displacement vector \\(\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x})\\in V\\) as:\n\n\\[\\int_\\Omega [2\\mu\\epsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{u})\\epsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{v})\n+\\lambda \\epsilon_{ii}(\\mathbf{u})\\epsilon_{jj}(\\mathbf{v})]\n=\\int_\\Omega \\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\mathbf{v} +\\int_\\Gamma \\mathbf{g}\\cdot \\mathbf{v},\n\\forall \\mathbf{v}\\in V\\]\nwhere \\(V\\) is the linear closed subspace of \\(H^1(\\Omega)^2\\).\n\nTip\nBeam\nConsider an elastic plate with the undeformed rectangle shape \\(]0,10[\\times ]0,2[\\).\nThe body force is the gravity force

assume the stress tensor \\(\\sigma_{ij}\\) is the state of plate stress regarding \\((x,y)\\in \\Omega_{\\Sigma}=\\Omega\\setminus \\Sigma\\).\nHere \\(\\Omega\\) stands for the undeformed shape of elastic plate without crack.\nIf the part \\(\\Gamma_N\\) of the boundary \\(\\partial\\Omega\\) is fixed and a load \\({\\cal L}=(\\mathbf{f},\\mathbf{g})\\in L^2(\\Omega)^2\\times L^2(\\Gamma_N)^2\\) is given, then the displacement \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the minimizer of the potential energy functional:\n\n\\[{\\cal E}(\\mathbf{v};{\\cal

decomposed in an open neighborhood \\(U_k\\) of \\(\\gamma_k\\) as in (see e.g. [OHTSUKA2000])\n\n(49)¶\\[\\mathbf{u}(x) =\n\\sum_{l=1}^2 K_l(\\gamma_k) r_k^{1/2} S^C_{kl}(\\theta_k)\n+

\\(\\mu\\) is the shear modulus of elasticity, \\(\\kappa=3-4\\nu\\) (\\(\\nu\\) is the Poisson’s ratio) for plane strain and \\(\\kappa=\\frac {3-\\nu} {1+\\nu}\\) for plane stress.\nThe coefficients \\(K_1(\\gamma_i)\\) and \\(K_2(\\gamma_i),\\) which are important parameters in fracture mechanics, are called stress intensity factors of the opening mode (mode I) and the sliding mode (mode II), respectively.\nFor simplicity, we consider the following simple crack\n\n\\[\\Omega=\\{(x,y):\\; -1<x<1, -1<y<1\\},\\qquad\n\\Sigma=\\{(x,y):\\; -1\\le x\\le 0, y=0\\}\\]\nwith only one crack tip \\(\\gamma=(0,0)\\).\nUnfortunately, FreeFem++ cannot treat crack, so we use the modification of the domain with U-shape channel (see U-shape example, Fig. 30) with \\(d=0.0001\\).\nThe undeformed crack \\(\\Sigma\\) is approximated by\n\n\\[\\Sigma_d = \\{(x,y):\\; -1\\le x\\le -10*d, -d\\le y\\le d\\} \\cup\\{(x,y):\\; -10*d\\le x\\le 0, -d+0.1*x\\le y\\le d-0.1*x\\}\\]\nand \\(\\Gamma_D=\\)R in U-shape example, Fig. 30.\nIn this example, we use three technique:\n\nFast Finite Element Interpolator from the mesh Th to Zoom for the scale-up of near \\(\\gamma\\).\n\nAfter obtaining the displacement vector \\(\\mathbf{u}=(u,v)\\), we shall watch the deformation of the crack near \\(\\gamma\\) as follows,\nmesh Plate = movemesh(Zoom, [x+u, y+v]);\nplot(Plate);\n\n\n\nAdaptivity is an important technique here, because a large singularity occurs at \\(\\gamma\\) as shown in (49).\n\n\nThe first example creates mode I deformation by the opposed surface force on B and T in the vertical direction of \\(\\Sigma\\), and the displacement is fixed on R.\nIn a laboratory, fracture engineers use photoelasticity to make stress field visible, which shows the principal stress difference\n\n\\[\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2=\\sqrt{(\\sigma_{11}-\\sigma_{22})^2+4\\sigma_{12}^2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) are the principal stresses.\nIn opening mode, the

and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.\nWe solve (50) by FEM in space and finite differences in time.\nWe use the definition of the partial derivative of the solution in the time derivative:\n\n\\[\\frac{\\p u}{\\p t}(x,y,t) = \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0}\\frac{u(x,y,t)-u(x,y,t-\\tau )}{\\tau }\\]\nwhich indicates that \\(u^m(x,y)=u(x,y,m\\tau )\\) will satisfy

equation\n\n(54)¶\\[\\p_t u +\\mathbf{\\alpha} \\cdot \\nabla u=f;\\ \\textrm{ for a vector-valued function }\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\]\nappears frequently in scientific problems, for example in the Navier-Stokes equations, in the Convection-Diffusion equation, etc.\nIn the case of 1-dimensional space, we can easily find the general solution \\((x,t)\\mapsto u(x,t)=u^0(x-\\alpha t)\\) of the following equation, if \\(\\alpha\\) is constant,\n\n(55)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\p_t u +\\alpha\\p_x u &=& 0\\\\\n    u(x,0) &=& u^0(x),\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nbecause \\(\\p_t u +\\alpha\\p_x u=-\\alpha\\dot{u}^0+a\\dot{u}^0=0\\), where \\(\\dot{u}^0=du^0(x)/dx\\).\nEven if \\(\\alpha\\) is not constant, the construction works on similar principles.\nOne begins with the ordinary differential equation (with the convention that \\(\\alpha\\) is prolonged by zero apart from \\((0,L)\\times (0,T)\\)):\n\n\\[\\dot{X}(\\tau )=+\\alpha(X(\\tau ),\\tau ),\\ \\tau \\in (0,t)\\quad X(t)=x\\]\nIn this equation \\(\\tau\\) is the variable and \\(x,t\\) are parameters, and we denote the solution by \\(X_{x,t}(\\tau )\\).\nThen it is noticed that \\((x,t)\\rightarrow v(X(\\tau),\\tau)\\) in \\(\\tau=t\\) satisfies the equation\n\n\\[\\p _{t}v+\\alpha\\p _{x}v=\\p _{t}X\\dot{v}+a\\p _{x}X\\dot{v}%\n=0\\]\nand by the definition \\(\\p _{t}X=\\dot{X}=+\\alpha\\) and \\(\\p_{x}X=\\p _{x}x\\) in \\(\\tau=t\\), because if \\(\\tau =t\\) we have \\(X(\\tau )=x\\).\nThe general solution of (55) is thus the value of the boundary condition in \\(X_{x, t}(0)\\), that is to say \\(u(x,t)=u^{0}(X_{x,t}(0))\\) where \\(X_{x,t}(0)\\) is on the \\(x\\) axis, \\(u(x,t)=u^{0}(X_{x,t}(0))\\) if \\(X_{x,t}(0)\\) is on the axis of \\(t\\).\nIn higher dimension \\(\\Omega \\subset R^{d},~d=2,3\\), the equation for the convection is written\n\n\\[\\p _{t}u+\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\cdot \\nabla u=0\\hbox{ in }\\Omega \\times (0,T)\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}(x,t)\\in \\R^{d}\\).\nFreeFem++ implements the Characteristic-Galerkin method for convection operators.\nRecall that the equation (54) can be discretized as\n\n\\[\\frac{Du}{Dt} =

operator.\nSo a good scheme is one step of backward convection by the method of Characteristics-Galerkin\n\n(56)¶\\[\\frac{1}{{\\tau }}\\left(u^{m + 1}(x) - u^m(X^m(x))\\right) = f^m (x)\\]\nwhere \\(X^m (x)\\) is an approximation of the solution at \\(t = m\\tau\\) of the ordinary differential equation\n\n\\[\\frac{d\\mathbf{X}}{dt}(t) = \\mathbf{\\alpha}^m(\\mathbf{X}(t)), \\mathbf{X}((m + 1)\\tau) = x.\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{\\alpha}^m(x)=(\\alpha_1(x,m\\tau ),\\alpha_2(x,m\\tau))\\).\nBecause, by Taylor’s expansion, we have\n\n(57)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    u^m(\\mathbf{X}(m\\tau ))&=&\n    u^m(\\mathbf{X}((m+1)\\tau )) -\n    \\tau \\sum_{i=1}^d \\frac{\\p u^m}{\\p x_i}(\\mathbf{X}((m+1)\\tau ))\n    \\frac{\\p X_i}{\\p t}((m+1)\\tau )\n    +o(\\tau

\\(u^m(x)=u(x,m\\tau )\\) and we used the chain rule and \\(x=\\mathbf{X}((m+1)\\tau )\\).\nFrom (57), it follows that\n\n\\[u^m(X^m(x))=u^m(x)-\\tau \\mathbf{\\alpha}^m(x)\\cdot \\nabla u^m(x)+o(\\tau )\\]\nAlso we apply Taylor’s expansion for \\(t \\rightarrow u^m(x-\\mathbf{\\alpha}^m(x)t),0\\le t\\le \\tau\\), then\n\n\\[u^m(x-\\mathbf{\\alpha}\\tau )=u^m(x)-\\tau \\mathbf{\\alpha}^m(x)\\cdot \\nabla u^m(x)+o(\\tau ).\\]\nPutting\nconvect\\(\\left( {\\mathbf{\\alpha},-\\tau ,u^m } \\right)\\approx u^m \\left(x - \\mathbf{\\alpha}^m\\tau \\right)\\)\nwe can get the approximation\n\\(u^m \\left( {X^m( x )} \\right) \\approx\\) convect \\(\\left( {[a_1^m ,a_2^m],-\\tau ,u^m } \\right)\\) by \\(X^m \\approx x \\mapsto x- \\tau [a_1^m(x) ,a_2^m(x)]\\)\nA classical convection problem is that of the “rotating bell” (quoted from [LUCQUIN1998], p.16).\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be the unit disk centered at 0, with its center rotating with speed \\(\\alpha_1 = y,\\, \\alpha_2 = -x\\).\nWe consider the problem (54) with \\(f=0\\) and the initial condition \\(u(x,0)=u^0(x)\\), that is, from (56)\n\\(u^{m + 1}(x) = u^m(X^m(x))\\approx\\) convect\\((\\mathbf{\\alpha},-\\tau ,u^m)\\)\nThe exact solution is \\(u(x, t) = u(\\mathbf{X}(t))\\) where \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) equals \\(x\\) rotated around the origin by an angle \\(\\theta = -t\\) (rotate in clockwise).\nSo, if \\(u^0\\) in a 3D perspective looks like a bell, then \\(u\\) will have exactly the same shape, but rotated by the same amount.\nThe program consists in solving the equation until \\(T = 2\\pi\\), that is for a full revolution and to compare the final solution with the initial one; they should be equal.\n\nTip\nConvect\n// Parameters\nreal dt = 0.17;\n\n//

lower (the maximum of \\(u^{37}\\) is \\(0.406\\) as shown in Fig. 205.\n\n\n\nFig. 204 \\(u^0=e^{-10((x-0.3)^2 +(y-0.3)^2)}\\)\n\n\n\nFig. 205 The bell at \\(t=6.29\\)\n\n\n\n\n2D Black-Scholes equation for an European Put option¶\nIn mathematical finance, an option on two assets is modeled by a Black-Scholes equations in two space variables, (see for example [WILMOTT1995] or [ACHDOU2005]).\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\p _t u &+& \\frac{{\\left( {\\sigma _1 x } \\right)^2 }}{2}\\frac{{\\p ^2 u}}{{\\p x^2 }} + \\frac{{\\left( {\\sigma _2 y } \\right)^2

\\left( {K - \\max \\left( {x ,y } \\right)} \\right)^+\\]\nBoundary conditions for this problem may not be so easy to device.\nAs in the one dimensional case the PDE contains boundary conditions on the axis \\(x_1 = 0\\) and on the axis \\(x_2 = 0\\), namely two one dimensional Black-Scholes equations driven respectively by the data \\(u\\left( {0, + \\infty ,T} \\right)\\) and \\(u\\left( { + \\infty ,0,T} \\right)\\).\nThese will be automatically accounted for because they are embedded in the PDE.\nSo if we do nothing in the variational form (i.e. if we take a Neumann boundary condition at these two axis in the strong form) there will be no disturbance to these.\nAt infinity in one of the variable, as in 1D, it makes sense to impose \\(u=0\\).\nWe take\n\n\\[\\sigma _1  = 0.3,\\;\\;\\sigma _2  = 0.3,\\;\\;\\rho  = 0.3,\\;\\;r = 0.05,\\;\\;K = 40,\\;\\;T = 0.5\\]\nAn implicit Euler scheme is used and a mesh adaptation is done every 10 time steps.\nTo have an unconditionally stable scheme, the first order terms are treated by the Characteristic Galerkin method, which, roughly, approximates\n\n\\[\\frac{{\\p u}}{{\\p t}} + a_1 \\frac{{\\p u}}{{\\p x}} + a_2

problem involves the Lamé system of elasticity and the Stokes system for viscous fluids with velocity \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and pressure \\(p\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcll}\n    -\\Delta\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{\\nabla} p &=& 0 & \\hbox{ in }\\Omega\\\\\n    \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{u} &=& 0 & \\hbox{ in }\\Omega\\\\\n    \\mathbf{u} &=& \\mathbf{u}_\\Gamma & \\hbox{ on }\\Gamma=\\partial\\Omega\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nwhere \\(u_\\Gamma\\) is the velocity of the boundaries.\nThe force that the fluid applies to the boundaries is the normal stress\n\n\\[\\mathbf{h} =(\\nabla\\mathbf{u} +\\nabla\\mathbf{u}^T)\\mathbf{n} -p\\mathbf{n}\\]\nElastic solids subject to forces deform: a point in the solid at (x,y) goes to (X,Y) after.\nWhen the displacement vector \\(\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2) = (X-x, Y-y)\\) is small, Hooke’s law relates the stress tensor \\(\\sigma\\) inside the solid to the deformation tensor \\(\\epsilon\\):\n\n\\[\\sigma_{ij} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij} \\nabla.\\mathbf{v} + 2\\mu\\epsilon_{ij},\n\\,\n\\epsilon_{ij} = {1\\over 2}({\\partial v_i\\over\\partial x_j} + {\\partial v_j\\over\\partial x_i} )\\]\nwhere \\(\\delta\\) is the Kronecker symbol and where \\(\\lambda\\), \\(\\mu\\) are two constants describing the material mechanical properties in terms of the modulus of elasticity, and Young’s modulus.\nThe equations of elasticity are naturally written in variational form for the displacement vector \\(v(x)\\in V\\) as:\n\n\\[\\int_\\Omega \\left[2\\mu\\epsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{v})\\epsilon_{ij}(\\mathbf{w})\n+\\lambda \\epsilon_{ii}(v)\\epsilon_{jj}(\\mathbf{w})\\right]\n=\\int_\\Omega \\mathbf{g}\\cdot \\mathbf{w} +\\int_\\Gamma \\mathbf{h}\\cdot \\mathbf{w},%\\`{u}\n\\forall \\mathbf{w}\\in V\\]\nThe data are the gravity force \\(\\mathbf{g}\\) and the boundary stress \\(\\mathbf{h}\\).\n\nTip\nFluide-structure\nIn our example, the Lamé system and the Stokes system are coupled by a common boundary on which the fluid stress creates a displacement of the boundary and hence changes the shape of the domain where the Stokes problem is integrated.\nThe geometry is that of a vertical driven cavity with an elastic lid.\nThe lid is a beam with weight so it will be deformed by its own weight and by the normal stress due to the fluid reaction.\nThe cavity is the \\(10 \\times 10\\) square and the lid is a rectangle of height \\(l=2\\).\nA beam sits on a box full of fluid rotating because the left vertical side has velocity one.\nThe beam is bent by its own weight, but the pressure of the fluid modifies the bending.\nThe bending displacement of the beam is given by \\((uu, vv)\\) whose solution is given as follows.\n// Parameters\nint bottombeam = 2; //label of bottombeam\nreal E = 21.5;\nreal sigma = 0.29;\nreal gravity = -0.05;\nreal coef = 0.2;\n\n// Mesh (solid)\nborder a(t=2, 0){x=0; y=t;

\\(\\mathbf{f}\\in L^2(\\Omega)^2\\):\n\n(58)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\left.\\begin{array}{cl}\n    -\\Delta \\mathbf{u}+\\nabla p & =\\mathbf{f} \\\\\n    \\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{u} &=0\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\\quad \\hbox{ in }\\Omega\\end{split}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{u}=(u_1,u_2)\\) is the velocity vector and \\(p\\) the pressure.\nFor simplicity, let us choose Dirichlet boundary conditions on the velocity, \\(\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{u}_{\\Gamma}\\) on \\(\\Gamma\\).\nIn [TEMAM1977], Theorem 2.2, there is a weak form of (58):\nFind \\(\\mathbf{v}=(v_1,v_2)\\in \\mathbf{V}(\\Omega)\\):\n\n\\[\\mathbf{V}(\\Omega)=\\{\\mathbf{w}\\in H^1_0(\\Omega)^2|\\; \\textrm{div}\\mathbf{w}=0\\}\\]\nwhich satisfy:\n\n\\[\\sum_{i=1}^2\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u_i\\cdot \\nabla v_i=\\int_{\\Omega}\\mathbf{f}\\cdot \\mathbf{w}\n\\quad \\textrm{for all }v\\in V\\]\nHere it is used the existence \\(p\\in H^1(\\Omega)\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{u}=\\nabla p\\), if:\n\n\\[\\int_{\\Omega}\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}=0\\quad \\textrm{for all }\\mathbf{v}\\in V\\]\nAnother weak form is derived as follows: We put:\n\n\\[\\mathbf{V}=H^1_0(\\Omega)^2;\\quad\nW=\\left\\{q\\in L^2(\\Omega)\\left|\\; \\int_{\\Omega}q=0\\right.\\right\\}\\]\nBy multiplying the first equation in (58) with \\(v\\in V\\) and the second with \\(q\\in W\\), subsequent integration over \\(\\Omega\\), and an application of Green’s formula, we have:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\nabla\\mathbf{v}-\\int_{\\Omega}\\textrm{div}\\mathbf{v}\\, p\n    &=&\\int_{\\Omega}\\mathbf{f}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}\\\\\n    \\int_{\\Omega}\\textrm{div}\\mathbf{u}\\, q&=&0\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThis yields the weak form of (58):\nFind \\((\\mathbf{u},p)\\in \\mathbf{V}\\times W\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    a(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})+b(\\mathbf{v},p)&=&(\\mathbf{f},\\mathbf{v})\\\\\n    b(\\mathbf{u},q)&=&0\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nfor all \\((\\mathbf{v},q)\\in V\\times W\\), where:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    a(\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v})&=&\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\nabla\\mathbf{v}\n    =\\sum_{i=1}^2\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla u_i\\cdot \\nabla v_i\\\\\n    b(\\mathbf{u},q)&=&-\\int_{\\Omega}\\textrm{div}\\mathbf{u}\\, q\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nNow, we consider finite element spaces \\(\\mathbf{V}_h\\subset \\mathbf{V}\\) and \\(W_h\\subset W\\), and we assume the following basis functions:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    &&\\mathbf{V}_h=V_h\\times V_h,\\quad\n    V_h=\\{v_h|\\; v_h=v_1\\phi_1+\\cdots +v_{M_V}\\phi_{M_V}\\},\\\\\n    &&W_h=\\{q_h|\\; q_h=q_1\\varphi_1+\\cdots +q_{M_W}\\varphi_{M_W}\\}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThe discrete weak form is: Find \\((\\mathbf{u}_{h},p_{h}) \\in \\mathbf{V}_{h} \\times W_{h}\\) such that:\n\n(59)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{cll}\n    a(\\mathbf{u}_h,\\mathbf{v}_h)+b(\\mathbf{v}_h,p) &= (\\mathbf{f},\\mathbf{v}_h) ,\n    &\\forall \\mathbf{v}_{h} \\in \\mathbf{V}_{h} \\\\\n    b(\\mathbf{u}_h,q_h)&= 0,\n    &\\forall q_{h} \\in W_{h}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\n\nNote\nAssume that:\n\nThere is a constant \\(\\alpha_h>0\\) such that:\n\n\n\\[a(\\mathbf{v}_h,\\mathbf{v}_h)\\ge \\alpha\\| \\mathbf{v}_h\\|_{1,\\Omega}^2\\quad \\textrm{for all }\\mathbf{v}_h\\in Z_h\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\[Z_h=\\{\\mathbf{v}_h\\in \\mathbf{V}_h|\\; b(\\mathbf{w}_h,q_h)=0\\quad \\textrm{for all }q_h\\in W_h\\}\\]\n\n\nThere is a constant \\(\\beta_h>0\\) such that:\n\n\n\\[\\sup_{\\mathbf{v}_h\\in \\mathbf{V}_h}\\frac{b(\\mathbf{v}_h,q_h)}{\\| \\mathbf{v}_h\\|_{1,\\Omega}}\n\\ge \\beta_h\\| q_h\\|_{0,\\Omega}\\quad \\textrm{for all }q_h\\in W_h\\]\nThen we have an unique solution \\((\\mathbf{u}_h,p_h)\\) of (59) satisfying:\n\n\\[\\| \\mathbf{u}-\\mathbf{u}_h\\|_{1,\\Omega}+\\| p-p_h\\|_{0,\\Omega}\n\\le C\\left(\n\\inf_{\\mathbf{v}_h\\in \\mathbf{V}_h}\\| u-v_h\\|_{1,\\Omega}\n+\\inf_{q_h\\in W_h}\\| p-q_h\\|_{0,\\Omega}\\right)\\]\nwith a constant \\(C>0\\) (see e.g. [ROBERTS1993], Theorem 10.4).\n\n\n\n\nLet us denote that:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    A&=&(A_{ij}),\\, A_{ij}=\\int_{\\Omega}\\nabla \\phi_j\\cdot \\nabla \\phi_i\\qquad\n    i,j=1,\\cdots,M_{\\mathbf{V}}\\\\\n    \\mathbf{B}&=&(Bx_{ij},By_{ij}),\\,\n    Bx_{ij}=-\\int_{\\Omega}\\p \\phi_j/\\p x\\, \\varphi_i\\qquad\n    By_{ij}=-\\int_{\\Omega}\\p \\phi_j/\\p y\\, \\varphi_i\\nonumber\\\\\n    &&\\qquad i=1,\\cdots,M_W;j=1,\\cdots,M_V\\nonumber\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nthen (59) is written by:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\mathbf{A}&\\mathbf{\\mathbf{B}}^*\\\\\n    \\mathbf{B}&0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\mathbf{U}_h\\\\\n    \\{p_h\\}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n    \\mathbf{F}_h\\\\\n

method: This method consists of replacing (59) by a more regular problem:\nFind \\((\\mathbf{v}_h^{\\epsilon},p_h^{\\epsilon})\\in \\mathbf{V}_h\\times \\tilde{W}_{h}\\) satisfying:\n\n(60)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{cll}\n    a(\\mathbf{u}_h^\\epsilon,\\mathbf{v}_h)+b(\\mathbf{v}_h,p_h^{\\epsilon}) &= (\\mathbf{f},\\mathbf{v}_h) ,\n    &\\forall \\mathbf{v}_{h} \\in \\mathbf{V}_{h} \\\\\n    b(\\mathbf{u}_h^{\\epsilon},q_h)-\\epsilon(p_h^{\\epsilon},q_h)&= 0,\n    &\\forall q_{h} \\in \\tilde{W}_{h}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{W}_h\\subset L^2(\\Omega)\\).\nFormally, we have:\n\n\\[\\textrm{div}\\mathbf{u}_h^{\\epsilon}=\\epsilon p_h^{\\epsilon}\\]\nand the corresponding algebraic problem:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{A}&B^*\\\\\nB&-\\epsilon I\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{U}_h^{\\epsilon}\\\\\n\\{p_h^{\\epsilon}\\}\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n=\n\\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\mathbf{F}_h\\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\\end{split}\\]\n\nNote\nWe can eliminate \\(p_h^\\epsilon=(1/\\epsilon)BU_h^{\\epsilon}\\) to obtain:\n\n(61)¶\\[(A+(1/\\epsilon)B^*B)\\mathbf{U}_h^{\\epsilon}=\\mathbf{F}_h^{\\epsilon}\\]\nSince the matrix \\(A+(1/\\epsilon)B^*B\\) is symmetric, positive-definite, and sparse, (61) can be solved by known technique.\nThere is a constant \\(C>0\\) independent of \\(\\epsilon\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\|\\mathbf{u}_h-\\mathbf{u}_h^\\epsilon\\|_{1,\\Omega}+\n\\|p_h-p_h^{\\epsilon}\\|_{0,\\Omega}\\le C\\epsilon\\]\n(see e.g. [ROBERTS1993], 17.2)\n\n\nTip\nCavity\nThe driven cavity flow problem is solved first at zero Reynolds number (Stokes flow) and then at Reynolds 100.\nThe velocity pressure formulation is used first and then the calculation is repeated with the stream function vorticity formulation.\nWe solve the driven cavity problem by the penalty method (60) where \\(\\mathbf{u}_{\\Gamma}\\cdot \\mathbf{n}=0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{u}_{\\Gamma}\\cdot \\mathbf{s}=1\\) on the top boundary and zero elsewhere (\\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is the unit normal to \\(\\Gamma\\), and \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) the unit tangent to \\(\\Gamma\\)).\nThe mesh is constructed by:\nmesh Th = square(8, 8);\n\n\nWe use a classical Taylor-Hood element technique to solve the problem:\nThe velocity is approximated with the \\(P_{2}\\) FE (\\(X_{h}\\) space), and the pressure is approximated with the \\(P_{1}\\) FE (\\(M_{h}\\) space), where:\n\n\\[X_{h} = \\left\\{ \\mathbf{v} \\in H^{1}(]0,1[^2) \\left|\\; \\forall K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}\\quad v_{|K} \\in P_{2}\\right.\\right\\}\\]\nand:\n\n\\[M_{h} = \\left\\{ v \\in H^{1}(]0,1[^2) \\left|\\; \\forall K \\in \\mathcal{T}_{h}\\quad v_{|K} \\in P_{1} \\right.\\right\\}\\]\nThe FE spaces and functions are constructed by:\nfespace Xh(Th, P2); //definition of the velocity component space\nfespace Mh(Th, P1); //definition of the pressure space\nXh u2, v2;\nXh u1, v1;\nMh p, q;\n\n\nThe Stokes operator is implemented as a system-solve for the velocity \\((u1,u2)\\) and the pressure \\(p\\).\nThe test function for the velocity is \\((v1,v2)\\) and \\(q\\) for the pressure, so the variational form (59) in freefem language is:\nsolve Stokes (u1, u2, p, v1, v2, q, solver=Crout)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n        (\n            dx(u1)*dx(v1)\n            + dy(u1)*dy(v1)\n            + dx(u2)*dx(v2)\n            + dy(u2)*dy(v2)\n        )\n        - p*q*(0.000001)\n        - p*dx(v1) - p*dy(v2)\n        - dx(u1)*q - dy(u2)*q\n    )\n    + on(3, u1=1, u2=0)\n    + on(1, 2, 4, u1=0, u2=0)\n    ;\n\n\nEach unknown has its own boundary conditions.\nIf the streamlines are required, they can be computed by finding \\(\\psi\\) such that \\(rot\\psi=u\\) or better:\n\n\\[-\\Delta\\psi=\\nabla\\times u\\]\nXh psi, phi;\n\nsolve streamlines (psi, phi)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          dx(psi)*dx(phi)\n        + dy(psi)*dy(phi)\n    )\n    + int2d(Th)(\n        - phi*(dy(u1) - dx(u2))\n    )\n    + on(1, 2, 3, 4, psi=0)\n    ;\n\n\nNow the Navier-Stokes equations are solved:\n\n\\[{\\p {u}\\over\\p t} +u\\cdot\\nabla u-\\nu \\Delta u+\\nabla p=0, \\nabla\\cdot u=0\\]\nwith the same boundary conditions and with initial conditions \\(u=0\\).\nThis is implemented by using the convection operator convect for the term \\({\\p u\\over\\p t} +u\\cdot\\nabla u\\), giving a discretization in time\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{cl}\n    \\frac{1}{\\tau } (u^{n+1}-u^n\\circ X^n) -\\nu\\Delta u^{n+1} + \\nabla p^{n+1} &=0,\\\\\n    \\nabla\\cdot u^{n+1} &= 0\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThe term \\(u^n\\circ X^n(x)\\approx u^n(x-u^n(x)\\tau )\\) will be computed by the operator convect, so we obtain:\nint i=0;\nreal alpha=1/dt;\nproblem NS (u1, u2, p, v1, v2, q, solver=Crout, init=i)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          alpha*(u1*v1 + u2*v2)\n        + nu * (\n              dx(u1)*dx(v1) + dy(u1)*dy(v1)\n            + dx(u2)*dx(v2) + dy(u2)*dy(v2)\n        )\n        - p*q*(0.000001)\n        - p*dx(v1) - p*dy(v2)\n        - dx(u1)*q - dy(u2)*q\n    )\n    + int2d(Th)(\n        - alpha*convect([up1,up2],-dt,up1)*v1\n        -

script is available in cavity example.\n\n\nUzawa Algorithm and Conjugate Gradients¶\nWe solve Stokes problem without penalty.\nThe classical iterative method of Uzawa is described by the algorithm (see e.g. [ROBERTS1993], 17.3, [GLOWINSKI1979], 13 or [GLOWINSKI1985], 13):\n\nInitialize: Let \\(p_h^0\\) be an arbitrary chosen element of \\(L^2(\\Omega)\\).\n\nCalculate :math:`mathbf{u}_h`: Once

S. Grudinin\nIn whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonators, which are typically spheres or disks, electromagnetic field is trapped by total internal reflections from the boundary.\nModes of such resonators are distinguished by compact volume and record high quality factors (Q) in a broad range of frequencies.\nModern applications of such resonators include microwave and optical cavities for atomic clocks, cavity optomechanics, nonlinear and quantum optics.\nAnalytical solutions for WG modes are only available for a limited number of idealized geometries, such as sphere or ellipsoid.\nSince resonator dimensions are typically much larger than optical wavelength, direct application of numerical 3D finite difference time domain (FDTD) or finite element methods (FEM) is not practical.\nIt’s possible to solve the vectorial wave equation by reducing it to a two dimensional case by taking axial symmetry into account.\nSuch reduction leads to a system of 3 equations to be solved in a 2D “\\(\\rho-z\\)” section of a resonator.\nPlease refer to [OXBORROW2007] for a detailed derivation and to [GRUDININ2012] for an example of using FreeFem++ to compute WGMs.\n\nWave equation for the WGMs¶\nSince electric field is discontinuous on the surface of a dielectric and magnetic field is typically not, we derive our equations for the magnetic field.\nThe electric field can be easily derived at a later stage from \\(\\vec{E}=\\frac{i}{\\omega\\epsilon_0}\\hat{\\epsilon}^{-1}\\nabla\\times\\vec{H}\\).\nFollowing a standard procedure starting with Maxwell equations we derive a wave equation in a single-axis anisotropic medium such as an optical crystal:\n\n(63)¶\\[\\nabla\\times\\left(\\hat{\\epsilon}^{-1}\\nabla\\times\\vec{H}\\right)-k_0^2\\vec{H}-\\alpha\\nabla\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\vec{H}\\right)=0\\]\nHere \\(k_0=\\omega/c\\) is the wavenumber, \\(\\alpha\\) is the penalty term added to fight spurious FEM solutions.\nFor anisotropic single-axis medium with \\(\\partial\\hat{\\epsilon}/\\partial\\phi=0\\) in cylindrical system of coordinates we have:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\hat{\\epsilon}=\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\rho} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\epsilon_{\\rho} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\epsilon_z \\end{pmatrix}. \\nonumber\\end{split}\\]\nWe now assume axial symmetry of our electromagnetic fields and insert an imaginary unity in front of the \\(H_{\\phi}\\) to allow all field components to be real numbers and also to account for the phase shift of this component \\(\\vec{H}(\\rho,\\phi,z)=\\left\\{H_{\\rho}(\\rho,z),iH_{\\phi}(\\rho,z),H_z(\\rho,z)\\right\\}\\times e^{im\\phi}\\).\nWe write the wave equation (63) explicitly in cylindrical coordinates, thus obtaining a set of three differential equations for the domain \\(\\Omega\\) given by the resonator’s cross section and some space outside:\n\n(64)¶\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    A_1\\{{H}_{\\rho}^t,{H}_{\\phi}^t,{H}_{z}^t\\}&=&0\\\\ \\nonumber\n    A_2\\{{H}_{\\rho}^t,{H}_{\\phi}^t,{H}_{z}^t\\}&=&0\\\\ \\nonumber\n    A_3\\{{H}_{\\rho}^t,{H}_{\\phi}^t,{H}_{z}^t\\}&=&0\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThe numerical solutions of these equations and boundary conditions can be found with FreeFem++ if we write the system in the weak, or integral form.\n\n\nWeak formulation¶\nIn general, to obtain the integral or “weak” statements equivalent to system (64) and boundary conditions we form a scalar dot product between an arbitrary magnetic field test function \\(\\mathbf{H}^t=\\{{H}_{\\rho}^t,{H}_{\\phi}^t,{H}_{z}^t\\}\\) and the components of our vectorial equation \\(A_1,A_2,A_3\\), and integrate over the resonator’s cross section domain \\(\\Omega\\) (and its boundary for the boundary conditions):\n\n\\[\\int\\limits_{\\Omega}(H^t_{\\rho}A_1+H^t_{\\phi}A_2+H^t_{z}A_3)d\\Omega\\]\nWe can reduce the order of partial derivatives in this integral by using the Green’s formula for integration by parts.\nFor example:\n\n\\[\\int\\limits_{\\Omega}H_z^t \\frac{\\partial^2 H_z}{\\partial \\rho^2 }d\\Omega=\n-\\int\\limits_{\\Omega}\\frac{\\partial H_z^t}{\\partial \\rho}\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial \\rho }d\\Omega+\\oint H_z^t\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial \\rho}n_{\\rho}d\\Gamma\\]\nThus converting equations (64) we obtain a large expression for the weak form.\n\n\nA dielectric sphere example with FreeFem++¶\nWe now compute the fundamental mode frequency for a fused silica

an output stream, for example cout or a ofstream.\nAll this methods, excepted the first, return a stream, so they can be chained:\ncout.scientific.showpos << 3 << endl;\n\n\n\nprecision¶\nSet the number of digits printed to the right of the decimal point.\nThis applies to all subsequent floating point numbers written to that output stream.\nHowever, this won’t make floating-point “integers” print with a decimal point.\nIt’s necessary to use fixed for that effect.\nint np = f.precision(n)\n\n\n\n\nscientific¶\nFormats floating-point numbers in scientific notation\nf.scientific\n\n\n\n\nfixed¶\nUsed fixed point notation for floating-point numbers.\nOpposite of scientific.\nf.fixed\n\n\n\n\nshowbase¶\nConverts insertions to an external form that can be read according to the C++ lexical conventions for integral constants.\nBy default, showbase is not set.\nf.showbase\n\n\n\n\nnoshowbase¶\nUnset showbase flags.\nf.noshowbase\n\n\n\n\nshowpos¶\nInserts a plus sign (+) into a decimal conversion of a positive integral value.\nf.showpos\n\n\n\n\nnoshowpos¶\nUnset showpos flags.\nf.noshowpos\n\n\n\n\ndefault¶\nReset all the previous flags to the default expect precision.\nf.default\n\n\n\n\nsetw¶\nBehaves as if member width were called with n as argument on the stream on which it is inserted as a manipulator (it can be inserted on output streams).\nf.setw(n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n

FreeFem++ language reference documentation.\n\nIntroduction¶\nIn essence FreeFem++ is a compiler: its language is typed, polymorphic, with exception and reentrant.\nEvery variable must be declared of a certain type, in a declarative statement; each statement are separated from the next by a semicolon ;.\nThe language allows the manipulation of basic types integers (int), reals (real), strings (string), arrays (example: real[int]), bi-dimensional (2D) finite element meshes (mesh), 2D finite element spaces (fespace), analytical functions (func), arrays of finite element functions (func[basic_type]), linear and bilinear operators, sparse matrices, vectors , etc.\nFor example:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6int i, n = 20; //i, n are integer\nreal[int] xx(n), yy(n); //two array of size n\nfor (i = 0; i <= 20; i++){ //which can be used in statements such as\n    xx[i] = cos(i*pi/10);\n    yy[i] = sin(i*pi/10);\n}\n\n\nThe life of a variable is the current block {...}, except the fespace variable, and the variables local to a block are destroyed at the end of the block as follows.\n\nTip\nExample\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 6\n 7\n 8\n 9\n10\n11real r = 0.01;\nmesh Th = square(10, 10); //unit square mesh\nfespace Vh(Th, P1); //P1 Lagrange finite element space\nVh u = x + exp(y);\nfunc f = z*x + r*log(y);\nplot(u, wait=true);\n{ // new block\n    real r = 2; //not the same r\n    fespace Vh(Th, P1); //error because Vh is a global name\n}// end of block\n//here r back to 0.01\n\n\n\nThe type declarations are mandatory in FreeFem++; in the end this feature is an asset because it is easy to make bugs in a language with many implicit types.\nThe variable name is just an alphanumeric string, the underscore character _ is not allowed, because it will be used as an operator in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n

Uh(Th, P1);\nUh u;\n\nfespace UPh(Th, [P2, P2, P1]);\nUPh [Ux, Uy, p];\n\n\n\n\n\nMacro design¶\n\nmacro¶\nMacro type.\nmacro vU() [Ux, Uy] //\nmacro grad(u) [dx(u), dy(u)] //\n\n\nMacro ends with //.\n\nNote\nMacro concatenation\nYou can use the C concatenation operator ## inside a macro using #.\nIf Ux and Uy are defined as finite element function, you can define:\nmacro Grad(U) [grad(U#x), grad(U#y)] // End of macro\n\n\n\nSee Macro example\n\n\nNewMacro / EndMacro¶\n\nWarning\nIn developement - Not tested\n\nSet and end a macro\nNewMacro grad(u) [dx(u), dy(u)] EndMacro\n\n\n\n\nIFMACRO¶\nCheck if a macro exists and check its value.\nIFMACRO(AA) //check if macro AA exists\n...\nENDIFMACRO\n\nIFMACRO(AA, tt) //check if amcro exists and is equall to tt\n...\nENDIFMACRO\n\n\n\n\nENDIFMACRO¶\n\n\n\nFunctions design¶\n\nfunc¶\nFunction type.\nFunction without parameters (\\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) are implicitly considered):\nfunc f = x^2 + y^2;\n\n\n\nNote\nFunction’s type is defined by the expression’s type.\n\nFunction with parameters:\nfunc real f (real var){\n    return x^2 + y^2 + var^2;\n}\n\n\n\n\nElementary functions¶\nClass of basic functions (polynomials, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, circular) and the functions obtained from those by the four arithmetic operations\n\n\\[f(x) + g(x),\\, f(x) - g(x),\\, f(x)g(x),\\, f(x)/g(x)\\]\nand by composition \\(f(g(x))\\), each applied a finite number of times.\nIn FreeFem++, all elementary functions can thus be created.\nThe derivative of an elementary function is also an elementary function; however, the indefinite integral of an elementary function cannot always be expressed in terms of elementary functions.\nSee Elementary function example for a complete example.\n\n\nRandom functions¶\nFreeFem++ includes the Mersenne Twister random number generator.\nIt is a very fast and accurate random number generator of period \\(2^{219937}-1\\).\nSee randint32(), randint31(), randreal1(), randreal2(), randreal3(), randres53(), randinit(seed).\nIn addition, the ffrandom plugin interface random, srandom and srandomdev functions of the Unix libc library.\nThe range is \\(0 -- 2^{31}-1\\).\n\nNote\nIf srandomdev is not defined, a seed based on the current time is used.\n\ngsl plugin equally allows usage of all random functions of the gsllib, see gsl external library.\n\n\nFE-functions¶\nFinite element functions are also constructed like elementary functions by an arithmetic formula involving elementary functions.\nThe difference is that they are evaluated at declaration time and FreeFem++ stores the array of its values at the places associated with he degree of freedom of the finite element type.\nBy opposition, elementary functions are evaluated only when needed.\nHence FE-functions are not defined only by their formula but also by the mesh and the finite element which enter in their definitions.\nIf the value of a FE-function is requested at a point which is not a degree of freedom, an interpolation is used, leading to an interpolation error, while by contrast, an elementary function can be evaluated at any point exactly.\nfunc f = x^2*(1+y)^3 + y^2;\nmesh Th = square(20, 20, [-2+4*x, -2+4*y]); // ]-2, 2[^2\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh fh=f; //fh is the projection of f to Vh (real value)\nfunc zf = (x^2*(1+y)^3 + y^2)*exp(x + 1i*y);\nVh<complex> zh = zf; //zh is the projection of zf to complex value Vh space\n\n\nThe construction of fh = f is explained in Finite Element.\n\nWarning\nThe plot command only works for real or complex FE-functions, not for elementary functions.\n\n\n\n\nProblem design¶\n\nproblem¶\nProblem type.\nproblem Laplacian (u, uh) = ...\n\n\nFreeFem++ needs the variational form in the problem definition.\nIn order to solve the problem, just call:\nLaplacian;\n\n\n\nNote\nSolver\nA solver can be specified in the problem definition:\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, solver=CG) = ...\n\n\nThe default solver is sparsesolver or LU if any direct sparse solver is available.\nSolvers are listed in the Global variables section.\n\n\nNote\nStop test\nA criterion \\(\\varepsilon\\) can be defined for iterative methods, like CG for example:\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, solver=CG, eps=1.e-6) = ...\n\n\nIf \\(\\varepsilon>0\\), the stop test is:\n\n\\[||Ax-b|| < \\varepsilon\\]\nElse, the stop test is:\n\n\\[||Ax-b|| < \\frac{|\\varepsilon|}{||Ax_0-b||}\\]\n\n\nNote\nReconstruction\nThe keyword init controls the reconstruction of the internal problem matrix.\nIf init is set to false or 0, the matrix is reconstructed et each problem calls (or after a mesh modification), else the previously constructed matrix is used.\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, init=1) = ...\n\n\n\n\nNote\nPreconditioning\nA preconditioner can be specified in the problem definition:\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, precon=P) = ...\n\n\nThe preconditioning function must have a prototype like:\nfunc real[int] P(real[int] &xx);\n\n\n\n\nNote\n“Très grande valeur”\nThe “Très grand valeur” tgv (or Terrible giant value) used to implement the Dirichlet conditions can be modified in the problem definition:\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, tgv=1e30) = ...\n\n\nRefere to Problem definition for a description of the Dirichlet condition implementation.\n\n\nNote\nPivot tolerance\nThe tolerance of the pivot in UMFPACK, LU, Crout, Cholesky factorization can be modified in the problem definition:\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, solver=LU, tolpivot=1e-20) = ...\n\n\n\n\nNote\nUMFPACK\nTwo specific parameters for the UMFPACK can be modifed:\n\nTolerance of the pivot sym\nstrategy\n\nproblem Laplacian(u, uh, solver=LU, tolpivotsym=1e-1, strategy=0) = ...\n\n\nRefer to the UMFPACK website for more informations.\n\n\nNote\ndimKrylov\nDimension of the Krylov space\n\nUsage of problem is detailled in the tutorials.\n\n\nsolve¶\nSolve type.\nIdentical to problem but automatically solved.\nUsage of solve is detailled in the tutorials.\n\n\nvarf¶\nVariational form type.\nvarf vLaplacian (u, uh) = ...\n\n\nDirectly define a variational form.\nThis is the other way to define a problem in order to directly manage matrix and right hang side.\nUsage of varf is detailed in the tutorial.\n\n\n\nArray¶\nAn array stores multiple objects, and there are 2 kinds of arrays:\n\nthe first is similar to vector, i.e. array with integer indices\nthe second is array with string indices\n\nIn the first case, the size of the array must be known at execution time, and implementation is done with the KN<> class and all the vector operator of KN<> are implemented.\nArrays can be set like in Matlab or Scilab with the operator ::, the array generator of a:c is equivalent to a:1:c, and the array set by a:b:c is set to size \\(\\lfloor |(b-a)/c|+1 \\rfloor\\) and the value \\(i\\) is set by \\(a + i (b-a)/c\\).\nThere are int,real, complex array with, in the third case, two operators (.im, .re) to generate the real and imaginary real array from the complex array (without copy).\n\nNote\nQuantiles are points taken at regular intervals from the cumulative distribution function of a random variable.\nHere the array values are random.\nThis statistical function a.quantile(q) computes \\(v\\) from an array \\(a\\) of size \\(n\\) for a given number \\(q\\in ]0,1[\\) such that:\n\n\\[\\#\\{ i / a[i] < v \\} \\sim q*n\\]\nit is equivalent to \\(v = a[q*n]\\) when the array \\(a\\) is sorted.\n\nFor example, to declare, fill and display an array of real of size n:\nint n = 5;\nreal[int] Ai(n);\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    Ai[i] = i;\ncout << Ai << endl;\n\n\nThe output of this script is:\n5\n      0   1   2   3   4\n\n\nSee the Array example for a complete example.\n\nArray index¶\nArray index can be int or string:\nreal[int] Ai = [1, 1, 0, 0];\nreal[string] As = [1, 1, 0, 0];\n\n\n\n\nArray size¶\nThe size of an array is obtained using the keyword n:\nint ArraySize = Ai.n;\n\n\n\n\nArray sort¶\nTo sort an array:\nAi.sort;\n\n\n\n\nDouble array¶\nA double array (matrix) can be defined using two indexes:\nreal[int, int] Aii = [[1, 1], [0, 0]];\n\n\nThe two sizes are obtained using the keywords n and m:\nint ArraySize1 = Aii.n;\nint ArraySize2 = Aii.m;\n\n\nThe minimum and maximum values of an array (simple or double) can be obtained using:\nreal ArrayMin = Aii.min;\nreal ArrayMax = Aii.max;\n\n\nTh minimum and maximum position of an array can be obtained using:\nint mini = Aii.imin;\nint minj = Aii.jmin;\n\nint maxi = Aii.imax;\nint maxj = Aii.jmax;\n\n\n\nTip\nAn array can be obtained from a finite element function using:\nreal[int] aU = U[];\n\n\nwhere U is a finite element function.\n\n\n\nArray of FE functions¶\nIt is also possible to make an array of FE functions, with the same syntax, and we can treat them as vector valued function if we need them.\nThe syntax for space or vector finite function is\nint n = 100; //size of the array.\nVh[int] wh(n); //real scalar case\nWh[int] [uh,vh](n); //real vectorial case\nVh<complex>[int] cwh(n); //complex scalar case\nWh<complex>[int] [cuh, cvh](n); //complex vectorial case\n[cuh[2], cvh[2]] = [x, y]; //set interpolation of index 2\n\n// Array of Array\nreal [int][int] V(10);\nmatrix[int] B(10);\nreal [int, int][int] A(10);\n\n\n\nTip\nExample\nIn the following example, Poisson’s equation is solved for 3 different given functions \\(f=1,\\, \\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y),\\, |x-1||y-1|\\), whose solutions are stored in an array of FE function.\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(20, 20, [2*x, 2*y]);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u, v, f;\n\n// Problem\nproblem Poisson (u, v)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          dx(u)*dx(v)\n        + dy(u)*dy(v)\n    )\n    + int2d(Th)(\n        - f*v\n    )\n    + on(1, 2, 3, 4, u=0)\n    ;\n\nVh[int] uu(3); //an array of FE function\n// Solve problem 1\nf = 1;\nPoisson;\nuu[0] = u;\n// Solve problem 2\nf = sin(pi*x)*cos(pi*y);\nPoisson;\nuu[1] = u;\n// Solve problem 3\nf = abs(x-1)*abs(y-1);\nPoisson;\nuu[2] = u;\n\n// Plot\nfor (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)\n    plot(uu[i], wait=true);\n\n\nSee FE array example.\n\n\n\nMap arrays¶\nreal[string] map; //a dynamic array\n\nmap[\"1\"] = 2.0;\nmap[2] = 3.0; //2 is automatically cast to the string \"2\"\n\ncout << \"map[\\\"1\\\"] = \" << map[\"1\"] << endl;\ncout << \"map[2] = \" << map[2] << endl;\n\n\nIt is just a map of the standard template library so no operations on vector are allowed, except the selection of an item.\n\n\n\nmatrix¶\nDefines a sparse matrix.\nMatrices can be defined like vectors:\nmatrix A = [[1, 2, 3],\n            [4, 5, 6],\n            [7, 8, 9]];\n\n\nor using a variational form type (see Finite Element):\nmatrix Laplacian = vLaplacian(Uh, Uh);\n\n\nor from block of matrices:\nmatrix A1, ..., An;\nmatrix A = [[A1, ...], ..., [..., An]];\n\n\nor using sparse matrix set:\nA = [I, J, C];\n\n\n\nNote\nI and J are int[int] and C is real[int]. The matrix is defined as:\n\n\\[A = \\sum_k{C[k]M_{I[k], J[k]}}\\]\nwhere \\(M_{a, b} = \\left(\\delta_{ia}\\delta_{jb}\\right)_{ij}\\)\nI, J and C can be retrieved using [I, J, C] = A (arrays are automatically resized).\nThe size of the matrix is n = I.max;, m = J.max;.\n\nMatrices are designed using templates, so they can be real or complex:\nmatrix<real> A = ...\nmatrix<complex> Ai = ...\n\n\n\nNote\nSolver\nSee problem.\nThe default solver is GMRES.\nmatrix A = vLaplacian(Uh, Uh, solver=sparsesolver);\n\n\nor\nset(A , solver=sparsesolver);\n\n\n\n\nNote\nFactorize\nIf true, the factorization is done for LU, Cholesky or Crout.\nmatrix A = vLaplacian(Uh, Uh, solver=LU, factorize=1);\n\n\nor\nset(A , solver=LU, factorize=1);\n\n\n\n\nNote\nStop test\nSee problem.\n\n\nNote\nTrès grande valeur\nSee problem.\n\n\nNote\nPreconditioning\nSee problem.\n\n\nNote\nPivot tolerance\nSee problem.\n\n\nNote\nUMFPACK\nSee problem.\n\n\nNote\ndimKrylov\nSee problem.\n\n\nNote\ndatafilename\nName of the file containing solver parameters, see Parallel sparse solvers\n\n\nNote\nlparams\nVector of integer parameters for the solver, see Parallel sparse solvers\n\n\nNote\ndparams\nVector of real parameters for the solver, see Parallel sparse solvers\n\n\nNote\nsparams\nString parameters for the solver, see Parallel sparse solvers\n\n\nTip\nTo modify the solver, the stop test,… after the matrix construction, use the set keyword.\n\n\nMatrix size¶\nThe size of a matrix is obtain using:\nint NRows = A.n;\nint NColumns = A.m;\n\n\n\n\nMatrix resize¶\nTo resize a matrix, use:\nA.resize(n, m);\n\n\n\nWarning\nWhen resizing, all new terms are set to zero.\n\n\n\nMatrix diagonal¶\nThe diagonal of the matrix is obtained using:\nreal[int] Aii = A.diag;\n\n\n\n\nMatrix renumbering¶\nint[int] I(15, J(15);\nmatrix B = A;\nB = A(I, J);\nB = A(I^-1, J^-1);\n\n\n\n\nComplex matrix¶\nUse .im and .re to get the imaginary and real part of a complex matrix, respectively:\nmatrix<complex> C = ...\nmatrix R = C.re;\nmatrix I = C.im;\n\n\n\n\nDot product / Outer product¶\nThe dot product of two matrices is realized using:\nreal d = A' * B;\n\n\nThe outer product of two matrices is realized using:\nmatrix C = A * B'\n\n\nSee Matrix operations example for a complete example.\n\n\nMatrix inversion¶\nSee Matrix inversion example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","l":"reference/types.html"},"45":{"t":"References","p":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            FreeFem++ documentation\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                FreeFem++ on GitHub\n            \n            \n                 stars -  forks\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nReferences\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \nReferences¶\n\n\n\n[PIRONNEAU1998]PIRONNEAU, Olivier and LUCQUIN-DESREUX, Brigitte.

there is free outflow, slip velocity at the top (artificial) boundary and no-slip at the bottom.\nHowever the Navier-Stokes cum temperature equations have a RANS \\(k-\\epsilon\\) model and a Boussinesq approximation for the buoyancy.\nThis comes to :\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\partial_t\\theta+u\\nabla\\theta-\\nabla\\cdot(\\kappa_T^m\\nabla\\theta) &=& 0\\\\\n    \\partial_t u +u\\nabla u -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mu_T\\nabla u) +\\nabla p+ e(\\theta-\\theta_0)\\vec e_2 &=&0\\\\\n    \\nabla\\cdot u &=& 0\\\\\n    \\mu_T &=& c_\\mu\\frac{k^2}\\epsilon\\\\\n    \\kappa_T &=& \\kappa\\mu_T\\\\\n    \\partial_t k + u\\nabla k + \\epsilon -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mu_T\\nabla k) &=& \\frac{\\mu_T}2|\\nabla u+\\nabla u^T|^2\\\\\n    \\partial_t\\epsilon+u\\nabla\\epsilon + c_2\\frac{\\epsilon^2} k -\\frac{c_\\epsilon}{c_\\mu}\\nabla\\cdot (\\mu_T\\nabla\\epsilon) &=& \\frac{c_1}2 k|\\nabla u+\\nabla u^T|^2\\\\\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nWe use a time discretization which preserves positivity and uses the method of characteristics (\\(X^m(x)\\approx x-u^m(x)\\delta t\\))\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\frac 1{\\delta t}(\\theta^{m+1}-\\theta^m \\circ X^m)-\\nabla\\cdot(\\kappa_T^m\\nabla\\theta^{m+1}) &=& 0\\\\\n    \\frac1{\\delta t}(u^{m+1}-u^m \\circ X^m) -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mu_T^m\\nabla u^{m+1}) +\\nabla p^{m+1}+ e(\\theta^{m+1}-\\theta_0)\\vec e_2 &=& 0\\\\\n    \\nabla\\cdot u^{m+1} &=& 0\\\\\n    \\frac1{\\delta t}(k^{m+1}-k^m \\circ X^m) + k^{m+1}\\frac{\\epsilon^m}{k^m} -\\nabla\\cdot(\\mu_T^m\\nabla k^{m+1}) &=& \\frac{\\mu_T^m}2|\\nabla u^m+{\\nabla u^m}^T|^2\\\\\n    \\frac1{\\delta t}(\\epsilon^{m+1}-\\epsilon^m \\circ X^m) + c_2\\epsilon^{m+1}\\frac{\\epsilon^m} {k^m} -\\frac{c_\\epsilon}{c_\\mu}\\nabla\\dot(\\mu_T^m\\nabla\\epsilon^{m+1}) &=& \\frac{c_1}2 k^m|\\nabla u^m+{\\nabla u^m}^T|^2\\\\\n    \\mu_T ^{m+1} &=& c_\\mu\\frac{{k^{m+1}}^2}{\\epsilon^{m+1}}\\\\\n    \\kappa_T^{m+1} &=& \\kappa\\mu_T^{m+1}\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nIn variational form and with appropriated boundary conditions the problem is :\nload \"iovtk\"\n\nverbosity=0;\n\n// Parameters\nint nn = 15;\nint nnPlus = 5;\nreal l = 1.;\nreal L = 15.;\nreal hSlope = 0.1;\nreal H = 6.;\nreal h = 0.5;\n\nreal reylnods =500;\nreal beta = 0.01;\n\nreal eps = 9.81/303.;\nreal nu = 1;\nreal numu = nu/sqrt(0.09);\nreal nuep = pow(nu,1.5)/4.1;\nreal dt = 0.;\n\nreal Penalty = 1.e-6;\n\n// Mesh\nborder b1(t=0, l){x=t;

On the other hand the simulation data can be loaded into the Matlab / Octave workspace with the function:\nu = ffreaddata('filename.txt');\n\n\nTherefore to load the complete simulation result from the capacitor example the following statement sequence must be executed:\n%Where to find the ffmatlib commands\naddpath('ffmatlib');\n%Loads the mesh\n[p,b,t,nv,nbe,nt,labels]=ffreadmesh('capacitor.msh');\n%Loads scalar data\n[u]=ffreaddata('capacitor_potential.txt');\n%Loads vector field data\n[Ex,Ey]=ffreaddata('capacitor_field.txt');\n\n\n\n\n2D Plot Examples¶\nffpdeplot() is a plot solution for creating patch, contour, quiver, border, and mesh plots of 2D geometries.\nThe basic syntax is:\n[handles,varargout] = ffpdeplot(p,b,t,varargin)\n\n\nvarargin specifies parameter name / value pairs to control the plot behaviour.\nA table showing all options can be found in the ffmatlib documentation.\n\nPlot of the boundary and the mesh:\n\nffpdeplot(p,b,t,'Mesh','on','Boundary','on');\n\n\n\n\nFig. 127 Boundary and Mesh\n\n\nPatch plot (2D map or density plot) including mesh and boundary:\n\nffpdeplot(p,b,t,'XYData',u,'Mesh','on','Boundary','on', ...\n          'XLim',[-2 2],'YLim',[-2 2]);\n\n\n\n\nFig. 128 Patch Plot with Mesh\n\n\n3D surf plot:\n\nffpdeplot(p,b,t,'XYData',u,'ZStyle','continuous','Mesh','off');\nlighting gouraud;\nview([-47,24]);\ncamlight('headlight');\n\n\n\n\nFig. 129 3D Surf Plot\n\n\nContour (isovalue) and quiver (vector field) plot:\n\nffpdeplot(p,b,t,'XYData',u,'XYStyle','off','Mesh','off','Boundary','on', ...\n          'Contour','on','CStyle','monochrome','CColor','b', ...\n          'CGridParam',[150, 150],'FlowData',[Ex,Ey],'FGridParam',[24, 24], ...\n          'ColorBar','off','XLim',[-2 2],'YLim',[-2 2]);\n\n\n\n\nFig. 130 Contour and Quiver Plot\n\nDownload run through example:\nMatlab / Octave file\nFreeFem++ script\n\n\n3D Plot Examples¶\nA 3D plot command ffpdeplot3D() is under development.\nNote: The interface is not yet frozen and can still change.\nThe following example shows a slicing feature on a three-dimensional parallel plate capacitor.\n\n\nFig. 131 Slice on a 3D Parall Plate Capacitor\n\nDownload run through example:\nMatlab / Octave file\nFreeFem++ script\n\n\nReferences¶\n\nOctave\nMatlab\nffmatlib\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","l":"tutorial/matlabOctavePlot.html"},"56":{"t":"Membrane","p":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            FreeFem++ documentation\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                FreeFem++ on GitHub\n            \n            \n                 stars -  forks\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nMembrane\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \n\\[\\def\\T{{\\mathbb{T}}}\\]\n\nMembrane¶\nSummary :\nHere we shall learn how to solve a Dirichlet and/or mixed Dirichlet Neumann problem for the Laplace operator with application to the equilibrium of a membrane under load.\nWe shall also check the accuracy of the method and interface with other graphics packages\nAn elastic membrane \\(\\Omega\\) is attached to a planar rigid support \\(\\Gamma\\), and a force \\(f(x) dx\\) is exerted on each surface element \\(\\text{d}{x}=\\text{d}{x}_1 \\text{d}{x}_2\\).\nThe vertical membrane displacement, \\(\\varphi(x)\\), is obtained by solving Laplace’s equation:\n\n\\[-\\Delta \\varphi =f ~\\hbox{in}~ \\Omega\\]\nAs the membrane is fixed to its planar support, one has:\n\n\\[\\varphi |_{\\Gamma }=0\\]\nIf the support wasn’t planar but had an elevation \\(z(x_1,x_2)\\) then the boundary conditions would be of non-homogeneous Dirichlet type.\n\n\\[\\varphi|_{\\Gamma}=z\\]\nIf a part \\(\\Gamma_2\\) of the membrane border \\(\\Gamma\\) is not fixed to the support but is left hanging, then due to the membrane’s rigidity the angle with the normal vector \\(n\\) is zero; thus the boundary conditions are:\n\n\\[\\varphi|_{\\Gamma_1}=z,~~~~\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial n}|_{\\Gamma_2}=0\\]\nwhere \\(\\Gamma_1=\\Gamma-\\Gamma_2\\); recall that \\(\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial n}=\\nabla\\varphi\\cdot n\\)\nLet us recall also that the Laplace operator \\(\\Delta\\) is defined by:\n\n\\[\\Delta \\varphi = {\\partial ^{2}\\varphi \\over \\partial x^{2}_{1} }\n+ {\\partial ^{2}\\varphi \\over \\partial x_{2}^{2} }\\]\n\nTodo\nCheck references\n\nWith such “mixed boundary conditions” the problem has a unique solution (see Dautray-Lions (1988), Strang (1986) and Raviart-Thomas (1983)).\nThe easiest proof is to notice that \\(\\varphi\\) is the state of least energy, i.e.\n\n\\[E(\\phi) =\\min_{\\varphi-z\\in V} E(v) ,\\quad \\mbox{with} \\quad E(v)=\\int_\\Omega(\\frac12|\\nabla v|^2-fv )\\]\nand where \\(V\\) is the subspace of the Sobolev space \\(H^1(\\Omega)\\) of functions which have zero trace on \\(\\Gamma_1\\).\nRecall that (\\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}^d,~d=2\\) here):\n\n\\[H^1(\\Omega)=\\{u\\in L^2(\\Omega)~:~\\nabla u\\in (L^2(\\Omega))^d\\}\\]\nCalculus of variation shows that the minimum must satisfy, what is known as the weak form of the PDE or its variational formulation (also known here as the theorem of virtual work)\n\n\\[\\int_\\Omega \\nabla\\varphi\\cdot\\nabla w = \\int_\\Omega f w\\quad\\forall w\\in V\\]\nNext an integration by parts (Green’s formula) will show that this is equivalent to the PDE when second derivatives exist.\n\nWarning\nUnlike Freefem+ which had both weak and strong forms, FreeFem++ implements only weak formulations.\nIt is not possible to go further in using this software if you don’t know the weak form (i.e. variational formulation) of your problem: either you read a book, or ask help form a colleague or drop the matter.\nNow if you want to solve a system of PDE like \\(A(u,v)=0,~ B(u,v)=0\\) don’t close this manual, because in weak form it is\n\n\n\\[\\int_\\Omega(A(u,v)w_1+B(u,v)w_2)=0~~\\forall w_1,w_2...\\]\nExample\nLet an ellipse have the length of the semimajor axis \\(a=2\\), and unitary the semiminor axis.\nLet the surface force be \\(f=1\\).\nProgramming this case with FreeFem++ gives:\n// Parameters\nreal theta = 4.*pi/3.;\nreal a = 2.;

//Plot phi\nplot(Th, wait=true, ps=\"membraneTh.eps\"); //Plot Th\n\n// Save mesh\nsavemesh(Th,\"Th.msh\");\n\n\nA triangulation is built by the keyword buildmesh.\nThis keyword calls a triangulation subroutine based on the Delaunay test, which first triangulates with only the boundary points, then adds internal points by subdividing the edges.\nHow fine the triangulation becomes is controlled by the size of the closest boundary edges.\nThe PDE is then discretized using the triangular second order finite element method on the triangulation; as was briefly indicated in the previous chapter, a linear system is derived from the discrete formulation whose size is the number of vertices plus the number of mid-edges in the triangulation.\nThe system is solved by a multi-frontal Gauss LU factorization implemented in the package UMFPACK.\nThe keyword plot will display both \\(\\T_h\\) and \\(\\varphi\\) (remove Th if \\(\\varphi\\) only is desired) and the qualifier fill=true replaces the default option (colored level lines) by a full color display.\nplot(phi,wait=true,fill=true);

Notice the C++-like syntax; the user needs not study C++ for using FreeFem++, but it helps to guess what is allowed in the language.\nAccess to matrices and vectors\nInternally FreeFem++ will solve a linear system of the type\n\n(41)¶\\[\\sum_{j=0}^{M-1} A_{ij}u_j - F_i=0 ,\\quad i=0,\\cdots,M-1;\\qquad\nF_i=\\int_{\\Omega}f\\phi_i\\, \\text{d} x\\text{d} y\\]\nwhich is found by using (39) and replacing \\(v\\) by \\(\\phi_i\\) in (40).\nThe Dirichlet conditions are implemented by penalty, namely by setting \\(A_{ii}=10^{30}\\) and \\(F_i=10^{30}*0\\) if \\(i\\) is a boundary degree of freedom.\n\nNote\nThe number \\(10^{30}\\) is called tgv (très grande valeur or very high value in english) and it is generally possible to change this value, see the item :freefem`solve, tgv=`\n\nThe matrix \\(A=(A_{ij})\\) is called stiffness matrix.\nIf the user wants to access \\(A\\) directly he can do so by using (see section Variational form, Sparse matrix, PDE data vector for details).\nvarf a(u,v)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          dx(u)*dx(v)\n        + dy(u)*dy(v)\n    )\n    + on(C, u=0)\n    ;\nmatrix A = a(Vh, Vh); //stiffness matrix\n\n\nThe vector \\(F\\) in (41) can also be constructed manually:\nvarf l(unused,v)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          f*v\n    )\n    + on(C, unused=0)\n    ;\nVh F;\nF[] = l(0,Vh); //F[] is the vector associated to the function F\n\n\nThe problem can then be solved by:\nu[] = A^-1*F[]; //u[] is the vector associated to the function u\n\n\n\nNote\nHere u and F are finite element function, and u[] and F[] give the array of value associated (u[] \\(\\equiv (u_i)_{i=0,\\dots,M-1}\\) and F[] \\(\\equiv (F_i)_{i=0,\\dots,M-1}\\)).\nSo we have:\n\n\\[\\mathtt{u}(x,y) = \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \\mathtt{u[][}i\\mathtt{]} \\phi_i(x,y) ,\n\\qquad \\mathtt{F}(x,y) = \\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \\mathtt{F[][}i\\mathtt{]} \\phi_i(x,y)\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi_i, i=0...,,M-1\\) are the basis functions of Vh like in equation (ref{equation3}), and \\(M = \\mathtt{Vh.ndof}\\) is the number of degree of freedom (i.e. the dimension of the space Vh).\n\nThe linear system (41) is solved by UMFPACK unless another option is mentioned specifically as in:\nVh u, v;\nproblem Poisson(u, v, solver=CG) = int2d(...\n\n\nmeaning that Poisson is declared only here and when it is called (by simply writing Poisson;) then (41) will be solved by the Conjugate Gradient method.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","l":"tutorial/poisson.html"},"61":{"t":"Pure Convection : The Rotating Hill","p":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            FreeFem++ documentation\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                FreeFem++ on GitHub\n            \n            \n                 stars -  forks\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nPure Convection : The Rotating Hill\nSolution by a Characteristics-Galerkin Method\nSolution by Discontinuous-Galerkin FEM\nFinite Volume Methods can also be handled with FreeFem++ but it requires programming.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \nPure Convection : The Rotating Hill¶\nSummary:\nHere we will present two methods for upwinding for the simplest convection problem.\nWe will learn about Characteristics-Galerkin and Discontinuous-Galerkin Finite Element Methods.\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be the unit disk centered at \\((0,0)\\); consider the rotation vector field\n\n\\[\\mathbf{u} = [u1,u2], \\qquad u_1 = y,\\quad u_2 = -x\\]\nPure convection by \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\partial_t c + \\mathbf{u}.\\nabla c &= 0 &\\hbox{ in } \\Omega\\times(0,T)\\\\\n    c (t=0) &= c ^0 &\\hbox{ in } \\Omega.\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nThe exact solution \\(c(x_t,t)\\) at time \\(t\\) en point \\(x_t\\) is given by:\n\n\\[c(x_t,t)=c^0(x,0)\\]\nwhere \\(x_t\\) is the particle path in the flow starting at point \\(x\\) at time \\(0\\).

the plate is surrounded by air at temperature \\(u_e\\) and initially at temperature \\(u=u_0+\\frac x L u_1\\).\nIn the plane perpendicular to the plate at \\(z=Lz/2\\), the temperature varies little with the coordinate \\(z\\); as a first approximation the problem is 2D.\nWe must solve the temperature equation in \\(\\Omega\\) in a time interval (0,T).\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    \\partial_t u -\\nabla\\cdot(\\kappa\\nabla u) &= 0 & \\hbox{ in } \\Omega\\times(0,T)\\\\\n    u(x,y,0) &= u_0+x u_1 &\\\\\n    \\kappa\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial n} +\\alpha(u-u_e) &= 0 & \\hbox{ on } \\Gamma\\times(0,T)\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nHere the diffusion \\(\\kappa\\) will take two values, one below the middle horizontal line and ten times less above, so as to simulate a thermostat.\nThe term \\(\\alpha(u-u_e)\\) accounts for the loss of temperature by convection in air.\nMathematically this boundary condition is of Fourier (or Robin, or mixed) type.\nThe variational formulation is in \\(L^2(0,T;H^1(\\Omega))\\); in loose terms and after applying an implicit Euler finite difference approximation in time; we shall seek \\(u^n(x,y)\\) satisfying for all \\(w\\in H^1(\\Omega)\\):\n\n\\[\\int_\\Omega(\\frac{u^n-u^{n-1}}{\\delta t} w + \\kappa\\nabla u^n\\nabla w) +\\int_\\Gamma\\alpha(u^n-u_ue)w=0\\]\n// Parameters\nfunc u0 = 10. + 90.*x/6.;\nfunc k = 1.8*(y<0.5) + 0.2;\nreal ue = 25.;\nreal alpha=0.25;\nreal T=5.;\nreal dt=0.1 ;\n\n// Mesh\nmesh Th = square(30, 5, [6.*x,y]);\n\n// Fespace\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u=u0, v, uold;\n\n// Problem\nproblem thermic(u, v)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          u*v/dt\n        + k*(\n              dx(u) * dx(v)\n            + dy(u) * dy(v)\n        )\n    )\n    + int1d(Th, 1, 3)(\n          alpha*u*v\n    )\n    - int1d(Th, 1, 3)(\n          alpha*ue*v\n    )\n    - int2d(Th)(\n          uold*v/dt\n    )\n    + on(2, 4, u=u0)\n    ;\n\n// Time iterations\nofstream ff(\"thermic.dat\");\nfor(real t = 0;

For instance to print \\(x\\mapsto \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0.9)\\) one would do:\nfor(int i = 0; i < 20; i++)\n   cout << dy(u)(6.0*i/20.0,0.9) << endl;\n\n\n\nResults are shown on Fig. 88 and Fig. 89.\n\n\nFig. 88 Temperature at \\(t=4.9\\).\n\n\n\nFig. 89 Decay of temperature versus time at \\(x=3, y=0.5\\)\n\n\nAxisymmetry: 3D Rod with circular section¶\nLet us now deal with a cylindrical rod instead of a flat plate.\nFor simplicity we take \\(\\kappa=1\\).\nIn cylindrical coordinates, the Laplace operator becomes (\\(r\\) is the distance to the axis, \\(z\\) is the distance along the axis, \\(\\theta\\) polar angle in a fixed plane perpendicular to the axis):\n\n\\[\\Delta u = {1\\over r}\\partial _r(r\\partial _r u) + {1\\over r^2}\\partial ^2_{\\theta\\theta} u\n + \\partial ^2_{z z}.\\]\nSymmetry implies that we loose the dependence with respect to \\(\\theta\\); so the domain \\(\\Omega\\) is again a rectangle \\(]0,R[\\times]0,|[\\) .\nWe take the convention of numbering of the edges as in square() (1 for the bottom horizontal …); the problem is now:\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\begin{array}{rcl}\n    r\\partial_t u-\\partial _r(r\\partial _r u) - \\partial _z(r\\partial _z u) &= 0 &\\hbox{ in } \\Omega\\\\\n    u(t=0) &= u_0 + \\frac z{L_z} (u_1-u)&\\\\\n    u|_{\\Gamma_4} &= u_0&\\\\\n    u|_{\\Gamma_2} &= u_1&\\\\\n    \\alpha(u-u_e) + {\\partial u\\over \\partial n} |_{\\Gamma_1\\cup\\Gamma_3} &= 0&\n\\end{array}\\end{split}\\]\nNote that the PDE has been multiplied by \\(r\\).\nAfter discretization in time with an implicit scheme, with time steps dt, in the FreeFem++ syntax \\(r\\) becomes \\(x\\) and \\(z\\) becomes \\(y\\) and the problem is:\nproblem thermaxi(u, v)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          (u*v/dt + dx(u)*dx(v) + dy(u)*dy(v))*x\n    )\n    + int1d(Th, 3)(\n          alpha*x*u*v\n    )\n    - int1d(Th, 3)(\n          alpha*x*ue*v\n    )\n    - int2d(Th)(\n          uold*v*x/dt\n    )\n    + on(2, 4, u=u0);\n\n\n\nNote\nThe bilinear form degenerates at \\(x=0\\).\nStill one can prove existence and uniqueness for \\(u\\) and because of this degeneracy no boundary conditions need to be imposed on \\(\\Gamma_1\\).\n\n\n\nA Nonlinear Problem : Radiation¶\nHeat loss through radiation is a loss proportional to the absolute temperature to the fourth power (Stefan’s Law).\nThis adds to the loss by convection and gives the following boundary condition:\n\n\\[\\kappa{\\partial u\\over \\partial n} +\\alpha(u-u_e) + c[(u + 273)^4 - (u_e+273)^4] = 0\\]\nThe problem is nonlinear, and must be solved iteratively.\nIf \\(m\\) denotes the iteration index, a semi-linearization of the radiation condition gives\n\n\\[{\\partial u^{m+1}\\over \\partial n} + \\alpha(u^{m+1}-u_e)+ c(u^{m+1}-u_e)\n(u^m+u_e +546) ((u^m + 273)^2 + (u_e+273)^2) = 0,\\]\nbecause we have the identity \\(a^4 - b^4 = (a-b)(a+b)(a^2+b^2)\\).\nThe iterative process will work with \\(v=u-u_e\\).\n...\n// Parameters\nreal rad=1e-8;\nreal uek=ue+273;\n\n// Mesh\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh vold, w, v=u0-ue, b;\n\n// Problem\nproblem thermradia(v, w)\n    = int2d(Th)(\n          v*w/dt\n        + k*(dx(v) * dx(w) + dy(v) * dy(w))\n    )\n    + int1d(Th, 1, 3)(\n          b*v*w\n    )\n    - int2d(Th)(\n          vold*w/dt\n    )\n    + on(2, 4, v=u0-ue)\n    ;\n\nfor (real t=0;t<T;t+=dt){\n    vold = v;\n    for (int m = 0;

is mysterious as it copies also w2 and wp into sol.\nStructured data such as vectors of \\(X_h\\) here cannot be written component by component.\nHence w1=u is not allowed.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","l":"tutorial/timeDependentStokes.html"},"65":{"t":"Getting started","p":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            FreeFem++ documentation\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                FreeFem++ on GitHub\n            \n            \n                 stars -  forks\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nGetting started\nThe Development Cycle: Edit–Run/Visualize–Revise\nError management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \nGetting started¶\nThe FreeFem++ language is typed, polymorphic and reentrant with macro generation.\nEvery variable must be typed and declared in a statement. Each statement is separated from the next by a semicolon ;.\nThe FreeFem++ language is a C++ idiom with something that is more akin to LaTeX.\nFor the specialist, one key guideline is that FreeFem++ rarely generates an internal finite element array, this was adopted for speed and consequently FreeFem++ could be hard to beat in terms of execution speed, except for the time lost in the interpretation of the language (which can be reduced by a systematic usage of varf and matrix instead of problem).\n\nThe Development Cycle: Edit–Run/Visualize–Revise¶\nMany examples and tutorials are given there after and in the examples section.\nIt is better to study them and learn by example.\nIf you are a beginner in the finite element method, you may also have to read a book on variational formulations.\nThe development cycle includes the following steps:\nModeling: From strong forms of PDE to weak forms, one must know the variational formulation to use FreeFem++; one should also have an eye on the reusability of the variational formulation so as to keep the same internal matrices; a typical example is the time dependent heat equation with an implicit time scheme: the internal matrix can be factorized only once and FreeFem++ can be taught to do so.\nProgramming: Write the code in FreeFem++ language using a text editor such as the one provided in your integrated environment.\nRun: Run the code (here written in file mycode.edp).\nThat can also be done in terminal mode by :\nFreeFem++ mycode.edp\n\n\nVisualization: Use the keyword plot directly in mycode.edp to display functions while FreeFem++ is running.\nUse the plot-parameter wait=1 to stop the program at each plot.\nDebugging: A global variable debug (for example) can help as in wait=true to wait=false.\nbool debug = true;\n\nborder a(t=0, 2.*pi){x=cos(t); y=sin(t); label=1;};\nborder b(t=0, 2.*pi){x=0.8+0.3*cos(t); y=0.3*sin(t); label=2;};\n\nplot(a(50) + b(-30), wait=debug); //plot the borders to see the intersection\n//so change (0.8 in 0.3 in b)\n//if debug == true, press Enter to continue\n\nmesh Th = buildmesh(a(50) + b(-30));\nplot(Th, wait=debug); //plot Th then press Enter\n\nfespace Vh(Th,P2);\nVh f = sin(pi*x)*cos(pi*y);\nVh g = sin(pi*x + cos(pi*y));\n\nplot(f, wait=debug); //plot the function f\nplot(g, wait=debug); //plot the function g\n\n\nChanging debug to false will make the plots flow continuously.\nWatching the flow of graphs on the screen (while drinking coffee) can then become a pleasant experience.\n\nError management¶\nError messages are displayed in the console window.\nThey are not always very explicit because of the template structure of the C++ code (we did our best!).\nNevertheless they are displayed at the right place.\nFor example, if you forget parenthesis as in:\nbool debug = true;\nmesh Th = square(10,10;\nplot(Th);\n\n\nthen you will get the following message from FreeFem++:\n    2 : mesh Th = square(10,10;\n Error line number 2, in file bb.edp, before  token ;\nparse error\n  current line = 2\nCompile error : parse error\n        line number :2, ;\nerror Compile error : parse error\n        line number :2, ;\n code = 1\n\n\nIf you use the same symbol twice as in:\nreal aaa = 1;\nreal aaa;\n\n\nthen you will get the message:\n2 : real aaa; The identifier aaa exists\n      the existing type is <Pd>\n      the new  type is <Pd>\n\n\nIf you find that the program isn’t doing what you want you may also use cout to display in text format on the console window the value of variables, just as you would do in C++.\nThe following example works:\n...\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nVh u;\ncout << u;\nmatrix A = a(Vh, Vh);\ncout << A;\n\n\nAnother trick is to comment in and out by using // as in C++.\nFor example:\nreal aaa =1;\n// real aaa;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n    FreeFem++ 1987-\n\n\n    \n        Made with  on\n    \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n","l":"tutorial/tutorial.html"},"66":{"t":"Wifi Propagation","p":"\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            FreeFem++ documentation\n        \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                FreeFem++ on GitHub\n            \n            \n                 stars -  forks\n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\nWifi Propagation\nSummary\nPhysics\nCoding\nThe domain\nLet’s create a mesh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n    \nWifi Propagation¶\n\nSummary¶\nIn this tutorial, we will study the wifi signal power in a flat.\nAn awesome flat is especially designed for the experiment, with 2 walls:\n\n\nFig. 118 Flat\n\nEven if the flat seems small enough to be covered by wifi everywhere, it is still interesting to study where the signal’s power is the lowest.\nWe will study where to put the hotspot to get the best coverage, and as we’re a bit lazy we will only put it next to the left wall.\n\n\nPhysics¶\nIn a nutshell, the Wifi is a electromagnetic wave that contains a signal : Internet data.\nElectromagnetic waves are well know by physicists and are ruled by the 4 Maxwell equations which give you the solution for E, the electrical field, and B, the magnetic field, in space but also in time.\nWe don’t care about the time here, because the signal period is really short so our internet quality will not change with time.\nWithout time, we’re looking for stationaries solutions, and the Maxwell equations can be simplified to one equation, the Helmholtz one :\n\n\\[\\nabla^{2}E + \\frac{k^{2}}{n^{2}}E = 0\\]\nWhere k is the angular wavenumber of the wifi signal, and n the refractive index of the material the wave is in.\nIndeed, the main point of this study is the impact of walls on the signal’s power, where the n is different from air (where it is 1).\nIn walls, the refractive index is a complex number in which the two parts have a physic interpretation:\n\nThe real part defines the reflexion of the wall (the amount of signal that doesn’t pass).\nThe imaginary part defines the absorption of the wall (the amount that disappears).\n\nThe wifi hotspot (simulated by a simple circle) will be the boundary condition, with a non null value for our electrical field.\n\n\nCoding¶\n\nThe domain¶\nIn order to create the domain of experimentation, we need to create border objects, like this :\nreal a = 40, b = 40, c = 0.5;\nborder a00(t=0, 1) {x=a*t; y=0; label=1;}\nborder a10(t=0, 1) {x=a; y=b*t; label=1;}\nborder a20(t=1, 0) {x=a*t; y=b; label=1;}\nborder a30(t=1, 0) {x=0; y=b*t; label=1;}\nborder a01(t=0, 1) {x=c+(a-c*2)*t; y=c; label=1;}\nborder a11(t=0, 1) {x=a-c;

label=3;}\nborder b10(t=0, 1) {x=p+d; y=q+e*t; label=3;}\nborder b20(t=1, 0) {x=p+d*t; y=q+e; label=3;}\nborder b30(t=1, 0) {x=p; y=q+e*t; label=3;}\n\nreal r = 30, s =1 , j = 1, u = 15;\nborder c00(t=0, 1) {x=r+j*t;

bx <= 7; bx++){\n    border C(t=0, 2*pi){x=2+cos(t); y=bx*5+sin(t); label=2;}\n\n    mesh Th = buildmesh(a00(10*n) + a10(10*n) + a20(10*n) + a30(10*n)\n        + a01(10*n) + a11(10*n) + a21(10*n) + a31(10*n) + C(10)\n        + b00(5*n) + b10(5*n) + b20(5*n) + b30(5*n)\n        + c00(5*n) + c10(5*n) + c20(5*n) + c30(5*n));\n\n\nThe border C is our hotspot and as you can see a simple circle.\nTh is our final mesh, with all borders and the hotspot.\nLet’s resolve this equation !\nfespace Vh(Th, P1);\nfunc real wall() {\n   if (Th(x,y).region == Th(0.5,0.5).region || Th(x,y).region == Th(7,20.5).region || Th(x,y).region == Th(30.5,2).region) { return 1;
