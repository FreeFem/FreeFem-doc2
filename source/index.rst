**FreeFem++** is a partial differential equation solver for non-linear multi-physics systems in 2D and 3D.

Problems involving partial differential equations from several branches of physics, such as fluid-structure interactions, require interpolations of data on several meshes and their manipulation within one program.
**FreeFem++** includes a fast interpolation algorithm and a language for the manipulation of data on multiple meshes.

**FreeFem++** is written in C++ and its language is a C++ idiom.
